How do they work together to ensure data redundancy and scalability?

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using one over the other?

2. Explain the write concern and read concern in MongoDB.
What are the different levels of write concern (e.g., w: 1, w: "majority")?

How do read concerns like local, available, and linearizable affect consistency?

3. How does MongoDB handle data consistency in a sharded environment?

What happens when a write operation is issued?

How does MongoDB decide whether to write to the primary or secondary nodes in a replica set?

8. What is the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?
How does it work, and what are its stages?

How do you optimize aggregation pipelines for performance?

9. Explain the role of mongod and mongos in a MongoDB deployment.

How do they work, and in what use cases would you use them?

What are their limitations compared to normal collections?

12. Explain the concept of “indexing” in MongoDB.
What are the different types of indexes in MongoDB (e.g., compound, text, geospatial)?

How do indexes affect write performance and query performance?

13. What are the benefits and trade-offs of using a compound index in MongoDB?
When would you use a compound index, and how does it differ from a single-field index?

What performance considerations should be made when using compound indexes?
