                    <b>main</b> = the branch on that remote repository

                    <b>What it is</b>: A local pointer that remembers the last known state of the main branch on the remote server (origin).
<b>How it updates</b>: It is updated only when you run commands that communicate with the server, such as git fetch or git pull.
<b>Purpose</b>: It allows you to see the history of the remote branch without needing to be connected to the internet. When you run git status, Git compares your local main to origin/main to tell you if you are "ahead," "behind," or "diverged."

        <b>2. origin/HEAD</b> is a symbolic reference that points to the default branch of the remote repository named "origin". It usually points to the main branch, but it can point to any branch that is set as the default on the remote.

This is a symbolic reference (a pointer to a pointer).
    <b>What it is</b>: It points to the default branch that the remote server is configured to use.
    <b>How it works</b>: Think of it as a bookmark that the server keeps. If your remote server has set main as the default branch (the one that opens when you visit the repository URL), then origin/HEAD points to origin/main.
    <b>Purpose</b>: It tells your local Git client which branch is considered the "primary" or "default" branch on the server, even if the repository has many other branches.


    <b>origin/main</b> → remote main branch
    <b>origin/develop</b> → remote develop branch
    <b>origin/feature/login</b> → remote feature branch
    <b>origin/HEAD</b> → points to whichever branch is the default (currently main)

In a typical setup:
->     <b>origin/HEAD</b> points to <b>origin/main.</b>
-> <b>origin/main</b> points to a specific commit hash (e.g., a1b2c3d) on the server.


origin/HEAD -> origin/main

The default branch of the remote repository is main.

                    text1: `Introduced in Git 2.23, git restore is a command designed to simplify the process of discarding changes in your working directory or moving files between the staging area and the working directory. It is intended to be a more intuitive alternative to the older, overloaded git checkout command.
                    
                    Key Use Cases

    <b>Discarding local changes</b>: If you have modified a file in your working directory but haven't staged it yet, and you want to revert it to the version in the last commit:
    Bash
git restore &lt;file_name&gt;

<b>Unstaging a file</b>: If you have added a file to the staging area (git add) but want to remove it from staging while keeping your changes in the file:
Bash
git restore --staged &lt;file_name&gt;

<b>Restoring to a specific commit</b>: You can revert a file to its state as it existed in a specific commit:
Bash
git restore --source <commit_hash> &lt;file_name&gt;

<b>Why use git restore over git checkout?</b>
Historically, <b>git checkout</b> was used for two very different tasks: switching branches and discarding changes. This often led to confusion. <b>git restore</b> (along with <b>git switch</b>) splits these responsibilities, making it safer and clearer to perform file-level operations without accidentally switching your entire project to a different branch.

<b>Example Workflow</b>
git status
modified: App.java
modified: Utils.java

Discard changes to one file:
git restore App.java

Discard all changes:
git restore .

<b>Be Careful ⚠️</b>
git restore permanently discards uncommitted changes. Once restored, those changes cannot be recovered unless they were committed or saved elsewhere.

<b>git restore over git checkout</b>
they are <b>similar in this specific use case</b>, but they are not the same command overall.
<b>git checkout .</b>	Restore all modified tracked files (older syntax)
-> Restores all tracked files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
-> Discards uncommitted changes in the working directory.
-> This is the older syntax.
<b>git restore .</b>	Restore all modified tracked files (recommended)
-> Also restores all tracked files in the working directory.
-> Discards uncommitted changes.
-> This is the newer, recommended syntax (introduced in Git 2.23).

                {
                    text1: `<b>1. git merge</b>
    <b>What it is</b>: A non-destructive way to integrate changes. It takes the contents of a source branch and combines them with the target branch.
    <b>How it works</b>: It creates a brand-new "merge commit" on the target branch that has two parent commits (representing the meeting point of both branches).
    <b>Pros</b>: Preserves the exact historical timeline and context of when branches diverged and came back together.
    <b>Cons</b>: If you have many developers working concurrently, your project history can become cluttered with numerous merge commits.

    <b>2. git rebase</b>
    <b>What it is</b>: A linear history rewriting tool. It takes your feature branch commits and "re-plants" them on top of the tip of another branch (like main).
    <b>How it works</b>: Instead of creating a merge commit, Git rewrites the commit history by generating brand-new commit hashes for your changes as if you had started your work from the latest version of the target branch.
    <b>Pros</b>: Results in a clean, strictly linear project history that is much easier to read through tools like git log.
    <b>Cons</b>: Rewrites history. You should never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared remote repository, as it forces other collaborators to deal with broken or mismatched history.
    
    <b>Merge</b> combines two branches by creating a new merge commit, preserving the original branch history.
<b>Rebase</b> moves a branch to a new base by replaying its commits on top of another branch, creating a cleaner, linear history but rewriting commit hashes.
Use <b>merge</b> for shared branches and rebase for cleaning up your own feature branch before integration.

    <b>git merge</b> and <b>git rebase</b> are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but they do so in fundamentally different ways. The choice between them often depends on your team's workflow preferences and the importance of maintaining a clean commit history versus preserving the exact historical context of changes.
    
    <b>Visual Example</b>
Suppose your Git history looks like this:
main
A --- B --- C
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    \\
feature       D --- E


main has commits: A → B → C
feature has commits: D → E

Now, someone adds two commits to main:
main
A --- B --- C --- F --- G
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    \\  
feature     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  D --- E

You want to bring the latest changes from <b>main</b> into <b>feature</b>.

<b>Option 1: Merge</b>
git checkout feature
git merge main

Git creates a <b>new merge commit</b>.
A --- B --- C --- F --- G
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     \\
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D --- E ---- M
D and E stay exactly as they were.
Git adds a merge commit M.
History shows the actual branching and merging.
<b>Advantages</b>
-> Safe (doesn't rewrite history).
-> Preserves the real development history.
-> Good for shared/public branches.
<b>Disadvantages</b>
-> Creates extra merge commits.
-> History can become cluttered.

<b>Option 2: Rebase</b>
git checkout feature
git rebase main

Git does <b>not</b> create a merge commit.
<b>Instead it:</b>
Temporarily removes D and E.
Moves feature to G.
Replays D and E on top of G.
A --- B --- C --- F --- G --- D' --- E'

<b>Notice:</b>
D becomes D'
E becomes E'

These are <b>new commits</b> with new commit hashes.
History becomes linear.

<b>What Actually Happens During Rebase</b>
Original:
A --- B --- C
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D --- E

Main moves ahead:
A --- B --- C --- F --- G
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  \\    
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D --- E

After rebase:
A --- B --- C --- F --- G --- D' --- E' 
Git literally copies your commits and reapplies them.


<b>Which One is Better?</b>
Use Merge
Shared branches
Team collaboration
<b>main</b>
<b>develop</b>
Release branches

Example:
feature  ---> develop
develop  ---> main
Merge is usually preferred.

<b>Use Rebase</b>
Updating your own feature branch with the latest main
Before creating a Pull Request
Keeping history clean

Example:
git checkout feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

<b>Rule You Should Remember</b>
Never rebase public/shared branches.
If others have already pulled the branch, rebasing changes commit history and can cause problems for collaborators.

Instead of merging an entire branch with all of its accumulated changes, cherry-picking lets you hand-pick a single commit or a specific range of commits.
                    
                    git cherry-pick is used to <b>copy a specific commit (or commits) from one branch and apply it to another branch</b> without merging the entire branch.
                    
                    <b>How It Works</b>             
    <b>Identify the Commit</b>: You find the hash of the specific commit you want to copy (using git log).
    <b>Switch to Target Branch</b>: Ensure you are checked out on the branch where you want to apply the change.
    <b>Run the Command</b>: Execute git cherry-pick &lt;commit-hash&gt;.

                    <b>When to use cherry-pick</b>
Suppose you have:
main
feature/login

You made three commits in <b>feature/login</b>:
A -- B -- C
But only commit <b>B</b> contains a bug fix that you need in <b>main</b>.
Instead of merging the whole branch, you can cherry-pick commit <b>B</b>.


<b>Example</b>
<b>Step 1: Find the commit hash</b>
git log --oneline

<b>Output</b>:
a1b2c3d Add login page
d4e5f6g Fix login validation
h7i8j9k Improve UI

Suppose you want:
d4e5f6g Fix login validation

<b>Step 2: Switch to the target branch</b>
git checkout main
or
git switch main

<b>Step 3: Cherry-pick the commit</b>
git cherry-pick d4e5f6g

Git creates a new commit on main with the same changes.
<b>Before:</b>
feature
A -- B -- C
main
A

<b>After:</b>
feature
A -- B -- C
main
A -- B'

<b>B'</b> is a new commit with a different commit ID but the same changes as <b>B</b>.


<b>Cherry-pick multiple commits</b>
Pick individual commits
git cherry-pick abc123 def456 ghi789

Pick a range of commits
git cherry-pick A^..D

This includes:
A
B
C
D

<b>If there are conflicts</b>
Git pauses and shows conflict files.
Resolve the conflicts, then run:

git add .
git cherry-pick --continue

To cancel the cherry-pick:
git cherry-pick --abort

<b>Common use cases</b>
1. Move a bug fix to another branch
feature
|
|-- Bug Fix
|-- New Feature

Only move the bug fix to main.

                    git stash is a handy Git command that temporarily shelves (or "stashes") changes you've made to your working directory so you can work on something else, without needing to commit unfinished work.
                    
                    When you run git stash, it takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) and saves them on a stack of unfinished changes, reverting your working directory to match the last commit.

git stash

Or add a descriptive message:
git stash push -m "Working on login feature"

git stash list

Example:
stash@{0}: On feature/login: Working on login feature

<b>Apply the latest stash</b>
git stash apply
This restores the changes but keeps the stash in the stash list.

<b>Apply a specific stash</b>
git stash apply stash@{1}

<b>Apply and remove the stash</b>
git stash pop
This applies the most recent stashed changes back into your working directory and removes them from the stash list. (If you want to apply them without removing them from the list, use git stash apply instead).

    <strong>It’s a Default Alias:</strong>
    When you run
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">git clone &lt;url&gt;</span>,
    Git automatically creates a shorthand bookmark named
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">origin</span>
    pointing to that specific URL so you don't have to type out the full web address every time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>It Saves Time:</strong>
    Instead of typing
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">git push https://github.com/username/repository.git main</span>,
    you simply type
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">git push origin main</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>It’s Customizable:</strong>
    While <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">origin</span> is the conventional default name, it isn't hardcoded. You can rename it
    or even add multiple remotes (e.g.,
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">upstream</span>,
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">backup</span>)
    if you are working with forks or multiple servers.

                    <b>git reset</b>
Means:
Move the current branch pointer to another commit.
<b>--soft</b>
Means:
Move the branch pointer, but keep the changes between the old position and the new position staged.
<b>origin/main</b>
This is the remote-tracking branch representing the main branch on the origin remote.
So the complete meaning is:
Move my current local branch to <b>origin/main</b>, while keeping all changes from my removed local commits staged.

How <b>git reset --soft origin/main</b> works
1) Git moves the current branch pointer to the commit pointed to by origin/main.
2) The changes introduced by the commits that are no longer part of the branch are kept in the staging area (index). OR (The changes that were in the commits that are now "removed" from the branch are kept in the staging area (index).)
3) The working directory remains unchanged, so your files still contain all those changes.    

<b>Why would you do this?</b>
One common reason is to <b>combine several local commits into one clean commit.</b>

<b>Very important: origin/main is NOT your local main</b>
This distinction is important for interviews.
<b>origin/main</b>  → remote-tracking reference
<b>main        </b> → your local branch

<b>--soft</b>  → move HEAD, keep changes STAGED
<b>--mixed</b> → move HEAD, keep changes UNSTAGED
<b>--hard</b>  → move HEAD, DELETE changes`,
