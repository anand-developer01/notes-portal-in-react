          text1: `JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.

          The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates the execution contexts, and pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase.
          
          If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function's execution because the page hangs.
          
          A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions on the webpage, such as mouse clicks.
          
          An example of a blocking function is a function that calls an API from a remote server.
          
          The following example uses a big loop to simulate a blocking function:`,
          code1: `      function task(message) {
            // emulate time consuming task
            let n = 10000000000;
            while (n > 0){
                n--;
            }
            console.log(message);
        }
        
        console.log('Start script...');
        task('Call an API');
        console.log('Done!');`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, we have a big while loop inside the task() function that emulates a time-consuming task. The task() function is a blocking function.
      
          The script hangs for a few seconds (depending on how fast the computer is) and issues the following output:
          
          Start script...
          Download a file.
          Done!
          To execute the script, the JavaScript engine places the first call console.log() on top of the call stack and executes it. Then, it places the task() function on top of the call stack and executes the function.
          
          However, it'll take a while to complete the task() function. Therefore, you'll see the message 'Download a file.' a little time later. After the task() function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack.
          
          Finally, the JavaScript engine places the last call to the console.log('Done!') function and executes it, which will be very fast.
    
          Callbacks to the rescue
          To prevent a blocking function from blocking other activities, you typically put it in a callback function for execution later. For example:`,
          code1: `console.log('Start script...');
      
          setTimeout(() => {
              task('Download a file.');
          }, 1000);
          
          console.log('Done!');`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, you'll see the message 'Start script...' and 'Done!' immediately. And after that, you'll see the message 'Download a file'.
      
          Here's the output:
          
          Start script...
          Done!
          Download a file.
          As mentioned earlier, the JavaScript engine can do only one thing at a time. However, it's more precise to say that the JavaScript runtime can do one thing at a time.
          
          The web browser also has other components, not just the JavaScript engine.
          
          When you call the setTimeout() function, make a fetch request, or click a button, the web browser can do these activities concurrently and asynchronously.
          
          The setTimeout(), fetch requests and DOM events are parts of the Web APIs of the web browser.
          
          In our example, when calling the setTimeout() function, the JavaScript engine places it on the call stack, and the Web API creates a timer that expires in 1 second.
          
          Then JavaScript engine places the task() function into a queue called a callback queue or a task queue:
          
          The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.
          
          If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen:
          `,
          code1: `See another example:
      
          console.log('Hi!');
          
          setTimeout(() => {
              console.log('Execute immediately.');
          }, 0);
          
          console.log('Bye!');`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, the timeout is 0 seconds, so the message 'Execute immediately.' should appear before the message 'Bye!'. However, it doesn't work like that.
      
          The JavaScript engine places the following function call on the callback queue and executes it when the call stack is empty. In other words, the JavaScript engine executes it after the 
          
          console.log('Bye!').
          console.log('Execute immediately.');
          
          Here's the output:
            <span style="color:red">
            Hi!
            Bye!
            Execute immediately.
            </span>
          The following picture illustrates JavaScript runtime, Web API, Call stack, and Event loop:
          
          In this tutorial, you have learned about the JavaScript event loop, a constantly running process that coordinates the tasks between the call stack and callback queue to achieve concurrency.`,

      title: "hoisting",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

          hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope - all before code execution. In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.
    
          In JavaScript, "hoisting" refers to the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared in your code.
    
          Hoisting is a concept or behavior in JavaScript where the declaration of a function, variable, or class goes to the top of the scope they were defined in.
          
          Introduction to the JavaScript hoisting
    When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates the global execution context. The global execution context has two phases:
    
    <b>1) Creation </b>
    <b>2) Execution </b>
    During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of your code. This is known as hoisting in JavaScript.
    
    <b>Variable hoisting</b>
    Variable hoisting means the JavaScript engine moves the variable declarations to the top of the script. For example, the following example declares the counter variable and initialize its value to 1:`,
          code1: `console.log(counter); // 👉 undefined
          var counter = 1;`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, we reference the counter variable before the declaration.
          However, the first line of code doesn't cause an error. The reason is that the JavaScript engine moves the variable declaration to the top of the script.
          Technically, the code looks like the following in the execution phase:`,
          code1: `var counter;
          console.log(counter); // 👉 undefined
          counter = 1;`
        },
        {
          text1: `During the creation phase of the global execution context, the JavaScript engine places the variable counter in the memory and initializes its value to undefined.
          The let keyword
The following declares the variable counter with the let keyword:`,
          code1: `console.log(counter);
          let counter = 1;
          
          The JavaScript issues the following error:
          
          // "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'counter' before initialization
          // The error message explains that the counter variable is already in the heap memory. However, it hasn't been initialized.
          `
        },
        {
          text1: `Behind the scenes, the JavaScript engine hoists the variable declarations that use the let keyword. However, it doesn't initialize the let variables.

          Notice that if you access a variable that doesn't exist, the JavaScript will throw a different error:`,
          code1: `
          console.log(alien);
          let counter = 1;

          // Here is the error:
          // ReferenceError: alien is not defined
          `
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Function hoisting</b>
          Like variables, the JavaScript engine also hoists the function declarations. This means that the JavaScript engine also moves the function declarations to the top of the script. For example:`,
          code1: `let x = 20,
          y = 10;
        
        let result = add(x, y); 
        console.log(result); // 👉 30
        
        function add(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }
        
        Output: 30

        // In this example, we called the add() function before defining it. The above code is equivalent to the following:
        
        function add(a, b){
            return a + b;
        }
        
        let x = 20,
            y = 10;
        
        let result = add(x,y);
        console.log(result); // 👉 30`
        },
        {
          text1: `
          During the creation phase of the execution context, the JavaScript engine places the add() function declaration in the heap memory. To be precise, the JavaScript engine creates an object of the Function type and a function reference add that refers to the function object.
          
          Function expressions
          The following example changes the add from a regular function to a function expression:`,
          code1: `let x = 20,
          y = 10;
      
      let result = add(x,y); // ❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
      console.log(result);
      
      let add = function(x, y) {
          return x + y;
      }`
        },
        {
          text1: `If you execute the code, the following error will occur:
          Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
          
          During the creation phase of the global execution context, the JavaScript engine creates the add variable in the memory and initializes its value to undefined.
          
          When executing the following code, the add is undefined, hence, it isn't a function:
          
          let result = add(x,y);
          
          The add variable is assigned to an anonymous function only during the execution phase of the global execution context.
          
          Arrow functions
          The following example changes the add function expression to the arrow function:
          `,
          code1: `let x = 20,
          y = 10;
      
      let result = add(x,y); // ❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
      console.log(result);
      
      let add = (x, y) => x + y; `
        },
        {
          text1: `The code also issues the same error as the function expression example because arrow functions are syntactic sugar for defining function expressions.

          Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
          
          Similar to the functions expressions, arrow functions are not hoisted.
          
          <b>Summary</b>
          > JavaScript hoisting occurs during the creation phase of the execution context that moves the variable and function declarations to the top of the script.
          > The JavaScript engine hoists the variables declared using the let keyword, but it doesn't initialize them as the variables declared with the var keyword.
          > The JavaScript engine doesn't hoist the function expressions and arrow functions.`,

          <b>global execution context:</b>
          The global execution context is the top-level context in a JavaScript program. It represents the global scope, encompassing the entire program and all its components. This context sets the stage for the entire code execution process and plays a pivotal role in managing global variables and functions.
    
          There are two phases of JavaScript execution context:
    
          <b>Creation phase:</b> In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. It determines the values of variables and functions and sets up the scope chain for the execution context.
          
          <b>Execution phase:</b> In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. It processes any statements or expressions in the script and evaluates any function calls.
    
          Introduction to the JavaScript execution context
          Let's start with the following example:`,
          code1: `      let x = 10;
          function timesTen(a){
              return a * 10;
          }
          let y = timesTen(x);
          console.log(y); // 100`
        },
        {
          text1: ` In this example:
          > First, declare the <b>x</b> variable and initialize its value with <b>10</b>.
          > Second, declare the <b>timesTen()</b> function that accepts an argument and returns a value that is the result of the multiplication of the argument with 10.
          > Third, call the <b>timesTen()</b> function with the argument as the value of the <b>x</b> variable and store result in the variable <b>y</b>.
          > Finally, output the variable <b>y</b> to the Console.
    
          Behind the scenes, JavaScript does many things. in this tutorial, you will focus on execution contexts.
          When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates execution contexts.
          Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.
    
          <b>The creation phase:</b>
    
          When the JavaScript engine executes a script for the first time, it creates the global execution context. During this phase, the JavaScript engine performs the following tasks:
    
          > Create the global object i.e., <b>window</b> in the web browser or <b>global</b> in Node.js.
          > Create the <b>this</b> object and bind it to the global object.
          > Set up a memory heap for storing variables and function references.
          > Store the function declarations in the memory heap and variables within the global execution context with the initial values as <b>undefined</b>.
    
          When the JavaScript engine executes the code example above, it does the following in the creation phase:
    
          > First, store the variables <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> and function declaration timesTen() in the global execution context.
          > Second, initialize the variables <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> to <b>undefined</b>.
    
          <span style="background:yellow; width:300px; padding:10px;" class="text-center d-flex flex-column">
          <b>Global Execution Context</b> </br>Creation Phase (Web Browser)
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">Global Object : Window</span>
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">this : window</span>
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">x : undefined</span>
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">timesTen : function(){...}</span>
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">y : undefined</span>
          </span>

          After the creation phase, the global execution context moves to the execution phase.
    
          <b>The execution phase:</b>
    
          During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.

          <------------------------------>
          
          For each function call, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context.
    
          The function execution context is similar to the global execution context. But instead of creating the global object, the JavaScript engine creates the <b>arguments</b> object that is a reference to all the parameters of the function:

          During the execution phase of the function execution context, the JavaScript engine assigns <b>10</b> to the parameter <b>a</b> and returns the result (100) to the global execution context:

          To keep track of all the execution contexts, including the global execution context and function execution contexts, the JavaScript engine uses the call stack,`,

          See the following example:

          This issue is known as the leaks of the global variables.

        {
          text1: `The JavaScript execution contexts (Global execution context and function execution context) are executed via the JavaScript engine. In order to manage these execution contexts, the JS engine uses the call stack. So, the JS call stack is a data structure that keeps track information of the functions being called and executed. Thus, if the user invokes a function for execution, the specified function gets pushed/added in the call stack, and when the user returns from a function, it means the function is popped out from the call stack. Thus, call stack is a normal stack data structure that follows the stack order principal, i.e., LIFO (Last In First Out).

          Introduction to JavaScript Call Stack
          A call stack is a way for the JavaScript engine to keep track of its place in code that calls multiple functions. It has the information on what function is currently being run and what functions are invoked from within that function…
    
          Also, the JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts:
    
          <b>The global execution context</b>
          <b>Function execution contexts</b>
          The call stack works based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.
    
          When you execute a script, the JavaScript engine creates a global execution context and pushes it on top of the call stack.
    
          Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a function execution context for the function, pushes it on top of the call stack, and starts executing the function.
    
          If a function calls another function, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context for the function being called and pushes it on top of the call stack.
    
          When the current function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack and resumes the execution where it left off.
    
          The script will stop when the call stack is empty.
    
          <b>JavaScript call stack example</b>
          Let's start with the following example:`,
          code1: `function add(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        
        function average(a, b) {
            return add(a, b) / 2;
        }
        
        let x = average(10, 20);
        `
        },
        {
          text1: `      When the JavaScript engine executes this script, it places the global execution context denoted by <b>main()</b> or <b>global()</b> function on the call stack.

          The global execution context enters the creation phase and moves to the execution phase.
    
          The JavaScript engine executes the call to the <b>average(10, 20)</b> function and creates a function execution context for the <b>average()</b> function and pushes it on top of the call stack:
    
          The JavaScript engine starts executing the <b>average()</b> since because the <b>average()</b> function is on the top of the call stack.
    
          The <b>average()</b> function calls <b>add()</b> function. At this point, the JavaScript engine creates another function execution context for the <b>add()</b> function and places it on the top of the call stack:
    
          JavaScript engine executes the <b>add()</b> function and pops it off the call stack:
    
          At this point, the <b>average()</b> function is on the top of the call stack, the JavaScript engine executes and pops it off the call stack.
    
          Now, the call stack is empty so the script stops executing:
    
          The following picture illustrates the overall status of the Call Stack in all steps:
          
          <b>Stack Overflow</b>
The call stack has a fixed size, depending on the implementation of the host environment, either the web browser or Node.js.

If the number of execution contexts exceeds the size of the stack, a stack overflow error will occur.

For example, when you execute a recursive function that has no exit condition, the JavaScript engine will issue a stack overflow error:
`,
          code1: `function fn() {
            fn();
        }
        
        fn(); // stack overflow`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Asynchronous JavaScript</b>
          JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that the JavaScript engine has only one call stack. Therefore, it only can do one thing at a time.
          
          When executing a script, the JavaScript engine executes code from top to bottom, line by line. In other words, it is synchronous.
          
          Asynchronous means the JavaScript engine can execute other tasks while waiting for another task to be completed. For example, the JavaScript engine can:
          
          Request for data from a remote server.
          Display a spinner
          When the data is available, display it on the webpage.
          To do this, the JavaScript engine uses an event loop, which will be covered in the following tutorial.
          
          <b>Summary</b>
          JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts.

          ------------
          
          A pure function in JavaScript is a function that returns the same result if the same arguments(input) are passed in the function. Let's see what makes a function pure in detail:
          
          - The return value of the function on the function call should only be dependent on the input function arguments.
          - It should not modify any non-local state. It means the function should not manipulate anything other than the data - stored in the local variables declared within the function.
          The function should not have any side effects, such as reassigning non-local variables, mutating the state of any part of code that is not inside the function, or calling any non-pure functions inside it.
          
          Pure functions are building blocks of functional programming. They always yield consistent result and does not manipulate non-local state or have any side effects. There are mainly two requirements of a pure function:
          
          Consistent result:--
          - Same result for the same input every time.
          - Result is only dependent on the input arguments. As the function does not perform any operation that requires any variable or data from outside the scope of the function.
          
          No side effects some common side effects:--
          - Making an HTTP request
          - Mutating any data that is not part of the function
          - Printing to a screen or console
          - DOM Query/Manipulation
          - Using Math.random()

          An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a common JavaScript design pattern used to create a private scope for variables. It involves defining and invoking a function expression immediately after its creation. The primary purpose of an IIFE is to encapsulate variables within a local scope, preventing them from polluting the global scope.
          
          The basic syntax of an IIFE looks like this:`,
          code1: `(function() {
            // code inside this function is executed immediately
          })();`
        },

          text1: `Let's break down the components of this pattern:

          <b>Function Expression:</b>
          
          (function() { /* code */ }) is a function expression enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses around the function declaration are necessary to distinguish it from a function declaration statement.

          <b>Invocation (()):</b>
          The function is immediately invoked by adding an extra set of parentheses (function() { /* code */ })(). This causes the function to execute immediately after its definition.
          Use Cases:
          Encapsulation and Avoiding Global Scope Pollution:
          
          Variables declared inside an IIFE are scoped to the function, preventing them from leaking into the global scope.`,
          code1: `(function() {

          // console.log(localVar);
          Creating Private Variables:
          
          IIFE can be used to create private variables that are accessible only within the function scope.`,
          code1: `var counter = (function() {
            var count = 0;

          <b>Module Pattern:</b>
          
          IIFE is often used in the module pattern, where you can create self-contained modules with private state and expose only the necessary functionalities.`,
          code1: `var module = (function() {
            var privateVar = "I am private";

                privateFunction();

          text1: `Here, privateVar and privateFunction are encapsulated within the module, and only the public interface is exposed.

          The IIFE pattern is a powerful and widely used technique in JavaScript for creating private scopes, avoiding global scope pollution, and implementing modular patterns. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to execute code immediately and keep certain variables or functionalities private.

          Sometimes, you may see an IIFE that starts with a semicolon(;):
          
          ;(function() {
          /* */
          })();
          
          In this syntax, the semicolon is used to terminate the statement in case two or more JavaScript files are blindly concatenated into a single file.
          
          For example, you may have two file lib1.js and lib2.js which use IIFEs:
          
          (function(){
              // ...
          })()
              
          (function(){
              // ...
          })()
          
          <i>If you use a code bundler tool to concatenate code from both files into a single file, without the semicolon (;) the concatenated JavaScript code will cause a syntax error.</i>
          
          <b>Advantages and Use Cases</b>
          <b>1. Encapsulation</b>
IIFE provides encapsulation, allowing you to create private scopes for variables and functions. This prevents variable conflicts and unintended modifications of data in the global scope. Encapsulation is crucial in larger applications and when working with multiple libraries.

<b>2. Avoiding Global Pollution</b>
By encapsulating code within IIFE, you avoid polluting the global namespace. This is particularly important when you want to minimize naming clashes with other scripts or libraries in your project. It keeps your code modular and self-contained.

<b>3. Immediate Execution</b>
IIFE executes code immediately after declaration. This feature is beneficial when you need to perform initialization tasks, configure settings, or kickstart an application. It ensures that your code runs exactly when and where you intend.

<b>4. Data Privacy</b>
IIFE allows you to create closures, which help maintain data privacy. You can hide variables and functions inside an IIFE, exposing only what's necessary. This concept is fundamental to the Module Pattern, a widely-used design pattern in JavaScript.

Real-World Scenarios for IIFE
<b>1. Isolating Code</b>
When integrating third-party scripts or libraries, you can wrap them in an IIFE to isolate their functionality and avoid conflicts with your code.

Understanding <b>this</b> in javascript with arrow functions
Published Feb 02, 2018Last updated Jul 03, 2019
This post is meant as second part of Understanding <b>This</b> in javascript.

We will go through the same examples, but we will use arrow functions instead to compare the outputs.

The motivation of this second post about the scope is, despite arrow functions are a powerful addition to ES6, they must not be misused or abused.

Default <b>this</b> context
Arrow functions do not bind their own this, instead, they inherit the one from the parent scope, which is called <b>lexical scoping</b>. This makes arrow functions to be a great choice in some scenarios but a very bad one in others

If we look at the first example but using arrow functions
`,
          code1: `// define a function
          const myFunction = () => {
            console.log(this);
          };
          // call it
myFunction();

          `
        },
        {
          text1: `What can we expect this to be?.... exactly, same as with normal functions, window or global object. Same result but not the same reason. With normal functions the scoped is bound to the global one by default, arrows functions, as I said before, do not have their own this but they inherit it from the parent scope, in this case the global one.

          What would happen if we add "use strict"? Nothing, it will be the same result, since the scope comes from the parent one.`,
          code1: `
          // Arrow functions as methods
          const myObject = {
            myMethod: () => {
              console.log(this);
            }
          };`
        },
        {
          text1: `What about now?

          In this case, one could say, that it really depends on how the method is called, same as normal functions, but that's not the case here, let's see...
          
          myObject.myMethod() // this === window or global object
          
          const myMethod = myObject.myMethod;
          myMethod() // this === window or global object
          Weird right? Well, remember, arrow functions don't bind their own scope, but inherit it from the parent one, which in this case is window or the global object.
          
          Let's change the example a little bit`,
          code1: `const myObject = {
            myArrowFunction: null,
            myMethod: function () {
              this.myArrowFunction = () => { console.log(this) };

          const myArrowFunction = myObject.myArrowFunction;

          Explicit, Hard and New binding
          What would happen when we try to bind a scope with any of these techniques?
          
          let's see...`,

          text1: `As you see, it does not matter how we try to bind the scope, it will never work. Also, arrows functions are not constructors so you can not use new with them.

          API calls

          When to Use Arrow Functions:
          ----------------------------
          
          1) Short, Concise Functions:
          Arrow functions are well-suited for short, concise functions, especially when the function body is a single expression.
          
          2) Avoiding this Binding Issues:
          Arrow functions are useful in scenarios where you want to maintain the this context of the enclosing scope, avoiding common issues related to this binding in regular functions.
          
          3) Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions:
          Arrow functions are commonly used as callbacks in functions like map, filter, and reduce due to their concise syntax.
          
          Drawbacks:
          ---------
          1) No arguments Object:
          Arrow functions do not have their own arguments object. If you need to access the arguments passed to the function, you should use the rest parameters syntax (...args).
          
          2) Not Suitable for All Cases:
          While arrow functions are convenient for many scenarios, they may not be suitable for all use cases, especially when you need the this context to be dynamically determined.
          
          In summary, arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript and are commonly used in modern codebases. They are particularly useful for short, simple functions and for avoiding this binding issues in certain scenarios. However, it's essential to be aware of their behavior and limitations, especially when working with more complex use cases.`,

          Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

`,

          Here, the recurse() function is a recursive function. It is calling itself inside the function.

          Working of recursion in JavaScript
          A recursive function must have a condition to stop calling itself. Otherwise, the function is called indefinitely.

          Once the condition is met, the function stops calling itself. This is called a base condition.

          To prevent infinite recursion, you can use if...else statement (or similar approach) where one branch makes the recursive call, and the other doesn't.

          So, it generally looks like this.`,

                    countDown(newNumber);

          In JavaScript, an iterator is an object that provides a way to access the elements of a collection, one at a time, and in a sequential manner. Iterators are used to traverse data structures like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. They follow a standard interface with methods like next() that returns the next element in the sequence along with information about whether the iteration is complete.

          The iterator protocol defines how to produce a sequence of values from an object.
          An object becomes an iterator when it implements a next() method.


          Iterator Interface:
          An iterator must adhere to the following interface:

          <b>next() Method:</b>
          The next() method returns an object with two properties:
          value: the next element in the iteration.
          done: a boolean indicating whether the iteration is complete (true when the last element is reached).
          Here's a simple example of creating an iterator for an array:`,
          code1: `const iterableArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          const iterator = iterableArray[Symbol.iterator]();

          console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
          console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
          console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 4, done: false }
          console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 5, done: false }

          Closure in JavaScript is a form of lexical scoping used to preserve variables from the outer scope of a function in the inner scope of a function.

In JavaScript, a closure is a feature that allows a function to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executed outside that lexical scope. In simpler terms, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function even after the outer function has finished executing.

A closure is a function that has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This is possible because the inner function retains a reference to the scope of the outer function, even after the outer function has been executed.

          In other words, closure is created when a child function keep the environment of the parent scope even after the parent function has already executed 

          Variables created without a declaration keyword <b>(var, let, or const)</b> are always global, even if they are created inside a function.
          In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function is defined within another function, allowing the inner function to access variables from the outer (enclosing) function's scope. Closures have access to the outer function's variables, parameters, and even the outer function's this context. This provides a way to create private variables, maintain state, and create functions with behavior that depends on their lexical environment.

          Here are a few examples of closures in JavaScript:`,

          <b>Inner Functions:</b> Functions defined inside another function are called inner functions. These inner functions have access to the variables declared in the outer function, as well as to the global scope.

          In this code snippet, you're using <b>setTimeout</b> inside a loop to create three alerts, each displaying the value of i. However, due to the asynchronous nature of <b>setTimeout</b>, the alerts won't display as you might expect.

          Here's what happens:
          
          The loop starts, and i is initialized to 0.
          The first <b>setTimeout</b> is called with a delay of 1000 milliseconds. Since i is 0, the alert function is created to alert 0.
          The loop continues, and i becomes 1.
          The second <b>setTimeout</b> is called with a delay of 1001 milliseconds. Now, the alert function captures the current value of i, which is 1.
          The loop continues, and i becomes 2.
          The third <b>setTimeout</b> is called with a delay of 1002 milliseconds. Again, the alert function captures the current value of i, which is 2.
          By the time the alerts are triggered (after the specified delays), the value of i has already been updated to 3 due to the loop completing. Therefore, all three alerts display 3.`,
          code1: `for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            setTimeout(function() { alert(i); }, 1000 + i);

          // If you want each alert to display the corresponding value of i (0, 1, 2) after the specified delays, you need to create a closure to capture the current value of i at each iteration. You can achieve this by using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) like this:

            setTimeout(function(i_local) { 
              return function() { console.log(i_local); }

          Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class or a function. It promotes the idea of hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only the necessary functionalities to interact with that object.

          Closures allow you to create private variables and functions within a scope. This means that you can encapsulate certain data and functionality, preventing them from being accessed or modified from outside the closure. This is particularly useful when you want to hide implementation details and expose only a limited interface to other parts of your code.
        
          In Below example, we have a <b>createBook</b> function that takes a <b>title</b> and an <b>author</b> as arguments and returns an object with four methods: <b>getTitle</b>, <b>getAuthor</b>, <b>setTitle</b>, and <b>setAuthor</b>. These methods allow us to retrieve or update the values of the <b>_title</b> and <b>_author</b> variables, which are private to the <b>createBook</b> function and not accessible outside of it.

          Closures allow functions to retain their state even after they have finished executing. This means that variables inside a closure will still be accessible when the closure is invoked later on. This can be particularly useful when dealing with event handlers or asynchronous operations.          
          <u>Ex: 1---</u>
          In Below example, the <b>createTimer</b> function creates a closure that increments the <b>seconds</b> variable every second using <b>setInterval</b>. The closure retains the value of <b>seconds</b> even after the <b>createTimer</b> function has finished executing. This allows the timer to continue running and displaying the elapsed time.
          <u>Ex: 2---</u>
          In Below example, the <b>createCounter</b> function returns a function that increments and returns the value of the <b>count</b> variable each time it is called. Because the returned function is a closure, it keeps access to the <b>count</b> variable even after the <b>createCounter</b> function has returned, allowing it to maintain states across multiple function calls.

          Memorization is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive or time-consuming calculations in a cache or lookup table so that they can be quickly retrieved the next time the same calculation is needed. It can greatly improve the performance of a function or algorithm, especially if it is called multiple times with the same arguments.

          In the example above, the <b>memoizedAdd</b> function returns an inner function that calculates the sum of two numbers. The results of previous calculations are stored in the <b>cache</b> object. Before performing a new calculation, the inner function checks if the result for the given input parameters already exists in the cache. If it does, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing it.

          The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
    
          The apply() method in JavaScript is a built-in method that allows you to call a function with a specified this value and an array or array-like object of arguments. It is similar to the call() method, but instead of passing arguments one by one, you can pass them as an array.

          => The apply() method allows you to append elements of an array to another:

          In this example, the apply() method modifies the original array arr. Note that the Array.prototype.concat() method also provides the same result except that it returns the new array instead of modifying the original array.
          
          The syntax for the apply() method is as follows:

          <span style="color:red"> functionName.apply(thisValue, [arg1, arg2, ...]);</span>

          In JavaScript, the <b>this</b> keyword always refers to an object. The thing about it is that the object it refers to will vary depending on how and where this is being called.
    
          The value of this depends on how a function is called:
          
          <b>1) Global Context:</b>
          When used outside of any function, <b>this</b> refers to the global object. In a browser environment, the global object is <b>window</b>.
          
          
          <b>2) Function Context:</b>
          When used within a function, the value of <b>this</b> depends on how the function is called.
          If the function is called as a method of an object, <b>this</b> refers to the object itself.
          If the function is called as a standalone function, <b>this</b> refers to the global object (<b>window</b> in browsers) in non-strict mode, or it is <b>undefined</b> in strict mode.
    
          <b>A note about arrow functions:</b>
          In arrow functions, JavaScript sets the this lexically. This means that the arrow function doesn't create its own execution context but inherits the this from the outer function where the arrow function is defined.
    
          In most cases, this means this will refer to the window object as well:

          It's important to notice this because, for example, if we try to implement an arrow function to it as an object method, we won't be able to access the object through the this keyword:`,

          Strict mode makes several changes to regular JavaScript semantics:
    
          > Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.

          text1: `In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of some asynchronous operation or at a later time. 
      
          Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, especially in scenarios like event handling, asynchronous operations, and dealing with functions that take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server.
    
          We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
    
          when we have a function that might take a long time to complete, oftentimes we provide a callback function. This function encapsulates the code we would like to run at a later time when the blocking action (e.g a network call) has been resolved. This allows us to return control to the JS engine and defer the rest of the execution until after the call-stack has been cleared. This is the concept of asynchrony in JavaScript.
          
          Here's a simple example of a callback function:`,
          code1: `      function fetchData(callback) {

          In this example, fetchData is a function that simulates an asynchronous operation with a 2-second delay. It takes a callback function (handleData) as an argument and calls it with the fetched data after the operation is complete.
          
          Callback functions are crucial in scenarios where you want to ensure that certain code runs only after a specific operation is finished, especially when dealing with asynchronous tasks like AJAX requests, file I/O, or timers.
          
          It's worth noting that with the introduction of Promises and async/await in JavaScript, there are alternative ways to handle asynchronous operations that often result in more readable and maintainable code. However, understanding callbacks remains important as they are still widely used in JavaScript development.`,

          text1: `Short circuiting works by evaluating an expression from left to right and returning the value of the first operand that determines the final result.
          
          In the case of OR, the expression is evaluated until we get one true result because the result will always be true, independent of the further conditions. If there is an expression with ||(logical OR), and the first operand itself is true, then a short circuit occurs, evaluation stops, and true is returned. OR short-circuiting can also be used to replace if else statements just like AND short-circuiting in JavaScript. In JavaScript true||expression always returns true and the false || expression always returns the expression.

        The logical OR operator (<b>||</b>) returns <b>true</b> if at least one of its operands is <b>true</b>, and it returns <b>false</b> only if both operands are <b>false</b>. Like the <b>&&</b> operator, it also short-circuits its evaluation. If the left operand is <b>true</b>, there's no need to evaluate the right operand because the result is already determined to be <b>true</b>.

        <b>Logical OR (||)</b>: When using ||, if the first operand evaluates to true, the second operand is not evaluated because the result of the OR operation will always be true regardless of the second operand's value. Again, this is short-circuiting. For example:
        <span style="color:red">
        if (condition1 || condition2) {
        Code block
        }
        </span>
        // Here, if <b>condition1</b> evaluates to true, <b>condition2</b> will not be evaluated because the overall result of the <b>||</b> operation will be true anyway.

        // Short circuiting can be useful for improving performance and preventing potential errors, especially when the evaluation of the second operand involves complex or expensive operations, or when evaluating it could lead to unintended side effects.

        // in the case of the OR operator, short circuiting means that if the first value is a truthy value, it will immediately return that first value.

        is
        essentially a reference to another object called its prototype. This prototype is a
        fundamental concept in JavaScript's object-oriented programming model.

        // Prototypes: JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that it uses
        prototypes to inherit properties and methods from one object to another. In
        JavaScript,
        objects can be linked to other objects, forming a prototype chain. When a property
        or
        method is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine first checks if that property
        or
        method exists on the object itself. If it does not, it will check the object's
        prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. If the
        property
        or method is not found, it will return undefined.

        // Here's a clear breakdown:

        // Every object has a prototype: When you create an object in JavaScript, it
        automatically gets a prototype. This prototype is a regular JavaScript object
        itself,
        and it can have its own properties and methods.

        // The prototype chain: When you try to access a property or method on an object,
        JavaScript first checks if that property or method exists on the object itself. If
        it
        doesn't find it, it looks at the object's prototype, and if it's not there, it
        continues
        up the prototype chain until it finds the property or method or reaches the end of
        the
        chain (where the prototype is null).

        // both __proto__ and prototype are related to object inheritance, but they serve
        different purposes.

        // __proto__:
        // ----------
        // __proto__ is a property that exists on every object in JavaScript.
        // It's a reference to the prototype object from which the current object inherits.
        // When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if
        that
        property or method exists directly on the object itself.If it doesn't, JavaScript
        looks
        at the object's __proto__ to find it.This process continues up the prototype chain
        until
        the property or method is found or until the end of the chain is reached(i.e., when
        __proto__ becomes null).
        // It's important to note that __proto__ is considered deprecated and should not be
        used
        for production code. Instead, you should use Object.getPrototypeOf() to get the
        prototype of an object, and Object.setPrototypeOf() to set the prototype of an
        object.

        // prototype is a property that exists on constructor functions in JavaScript.
        // It's used to set up inheritance when you want to create objects using the new
        keyword.
        // When you create a constructor function and add properties or methods to its
        prototype, those properties and methods become available to instances created using
        that
        constructor function.
        // When you use the new keyword to create an instance of a constructor function, the
        newly created object's __proto__ is set to the constructor function's prototype.
        // In summary, __proto__ is a property that exists on every object and is used to
        reference the prototype of the object, while prototype is a property that exists on
        constructor functions and is used to set up inheritance for objects created using
        those
        constructor functions.

          // Getters: Functions that are called when the property is accessed.
          // Setters: Functions that are called when a new value is assigned to the property.

          values directly. The getter and setter functions handle value retrieval and
          assignment.
          // Flexibility: Accessor properties provide a way to add logic to the process of
          getting and setting property values, which can be useful for validation, computed
          properties, and encapsulation.

          // Object.defineProperty()
          //----------------

          // The Object.defineProperty() method adds a property or modifies an existing
          property on an object and returns the object.

          // The syntax of the defineProperty() method is:

          // Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
          // Here, 'defineProperty()' is a static method. Hence, we need to access the method
          using the class name, Object.


          // defineProperty() Parameters
          // The 'defineProperty()' method takes in:

          // 'obj' - the object on which to define the property.
          // 'prop' - the name or 'Symbol' of the property to be defined or modified.
          // 'descriptor' - the descriptor for the property being defined or modified.

          // Each property value must either be a data descriptor or an accessor
          descriptor.They can have the following optional properties:

          // configurable - the ability to change or delete a property's attributes
          // enumerable - the property that is visible in for...in loops and with
          Object.keys().
          // Data descriptors can also have:

          // value - the actual data stored in a property, accessible through its key.
          // writable - the ability to change the value of a property.If false, the property's
          value cannot be changed.`,

          Computed properties, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), allow you to create object properties dynamically using an expression in square brackets ([]). Instead of specifying a fixed property name, you can use an expression to compute the property name at runtime. This provides flexibility in working with object properties and enables dynamic behaviors.`,

          Private methods are defined within a class using the <b>#</b> prefix before the method name. These methods can be called from other methods within the same class but are not accessible from outside the class.
          
          To make a public method private, you prefix its name with a hash #. JavaScript allows you to define private methods for instance methods, <b>static methods</b>, and <b>getter/setters</b>.

The following shows the syntax of defining a private instance method:
          `,
          code1: `class MyClass {
            #privateMethod() {
              //...
            }
          }
          
          //---------------
          
          class Person {
            #name;
            
            constructor(name) {
              this.#name = name;
            }
          
            // Public method
            greet() {
              console.log(this.#getGreeting());
            }
          
            // Private method
            #getGreeting() {
              return 'Hello, my name is \${this.#name}';
            }
          }
          
          const person = new Person('Alice');
          person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
          
          // Trying to call the private method directly will result in an error
          console.log(person.#getGreeting()); // SyntaxError: Private field '#getGreeting' must be declared in an enclosing class
          
          `
        },
        {
          text1: `To call the <b>#privateStaticMethod()</b> inside the <b>MyClass</b>, you use the class name instead of the <b>this</b> keyword:

          <span style="color:grey"> MyClass.#privateStaticMethod(); </span>
          
          The following shows the syntax of the private getters/setters:
          
          <span style="color:grey">
          class MyClass {
            #field;
            get #myField() {
                return #field;
            }
            set #myField(value){
                #field = value;
            }
          }
          </span>
          
          In this example, the <b>#myField</b> is the private getter and setter that provides access to the private field <b>#field</b>.
          
          In practice, you use private methods to minimize the number of methods that the object exposes.
          
          As a rule of thumb, you should make all class methods private by default first. And then you make a method public whenever the object needs to use that method to interact with other objects.`,

          In JavaScript, the <b>instanceof</b> operator is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class or constructor function. It evaluates to <b>true</b> if the object is an instance of the specified class or a subclass of it, otherwise <b>false</b>.
