<b>Key Points</b>:
<b>Custom Modules</b>: You create local modules based on your application's requirements.
<b>Modularization</b>: Helps in organizing code into smaller, reusable chunks.

          text1: `Node.js HTTP module is a built-in library that allows developers to create web servers, as well as communicate with other APIs using HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2, and HTTPS.
                    
                    The http module in Node.js is one of the core modules that allows you to create web servers and handle HTTP requests and responses. It is essential for building APIs, web applications, or any service that needs to interact over HTTP or HTTPS.

                    The HTTP module extends two built-in classes:
<b>Net module</b>
Provides network API for creating stream-based TCP servers or clients.
<b>Events module</b>
Provides an event-driven architecture using EventEmitter class.

<b>Key Features of the http Module</b>
<b>Create HTTP Servers</b>: The <b>http</b> module allows you to create an HTTP server to listen for incoming HTTP requests and send responses back to the clients.
<b>Handle HTTP Requests and Responses</b>: It provides APIs to parse incoming HTTP requests and send out HTTP responses.
<b>HTTP Methods</b>: The module allows handling different HTTP methods such as <b>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,</b> etc.
<b>Custom Headers</b>: You can set custom headers and content in the HTTP response.

<b>Basic Usage of the http Module</b>
Here's how you can use the <b>http</b> module to create a simple HTTP server.
<b>Creating a Simple HTTP Server</b></b>:
<b>Import the <u>http</u> module</b>: You use the <b>require()</b> function to load the <b>http</b> module.
<b>Create the server</b>: Use the <b>http.createServer()</b> method to create a new HTTP server. The server takes a callback function that handles incoming requests and sends a response.
<b>Listen on a Port</b>: Use the <b>server.listen()</b> method to make the server listen on a specific port.

<b>http.createServer()</b>: Creates the HTTP server. The callback function <b>(req, res)</b> gets executed every time an incoming HTTP request is made.
<b>req</b>: Represents the incoming request object that contains data about the request.
<b>res</b>: Represents the outgoing response object, allowing you to send a response back to the client.
<b>res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })</b>: Sends the response header with a status code 200 (OK) and specifies the response type as plain text.
<b>res.end()</b>: Ends the response and sends the data <b>('Hello, world!')</b> to the client.
<b>server.listen(3000)</b>: Listens for incoming connections on port <b>3000</b>.

          code1: `const http = require('http');

// Create the server

                    <b>Packages</b>
npm installs, updates and manages downloads of dependencies of your project. Dependencies are pre-built pieces of code, such as libraries and packages, that your Node.js application needs to work.

                    <b>NPM consists of two main parts:</b>
a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages, and
an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages

<b>Key Features of NPM</b>:
<b>Package Management</b>:
=> NPM allows developers to <b>install, manage, and share</b> libraries (also known as packages) of code. These packages can be anything from utility functions, frameworks (like Express), databases, and even build tools.
=> With NPM, you can easily add dependencies to your project, manage their versions, and ensure that your project works consistently across different environments.

<b>Repository</b>:
=> NPM provides an <b>online repository</b> (https://www.npmjs.com/) where developers can publish and share their packages with the global community. This repository has millions of packages available for use.
=> When you run the <b>npm install</b> command, it downloads packages from the <b>NPM registry</b>.

<b>Dependency Management</b>:
=> NPM allows you to declare dependencies (libraries your project needs) in a <b>package.json</b> file. This file tracks all the dependencies, along with their versions, for your project.
=> You can also specify which versions of dependencies are required or allowed using semantic versioning.

<b>Scripts</b>:
=> NPM allows you to define <b>scripts</b> in the <b>package.json</b> file. These scripts are commonly used for automation tasks like testing, building, or starting your project. For example, you can run <b>npm run test</b> to execute your test suite.

<b>Versioning and Updates</b>:
=> NPM helps you manage the versions of packages you install. You can define specific versions of packages or use a range of versions.
=> You can easily <b>update</b> dependencies by running <b>npm update</b>.

<b>Global vs Local Installation</b>:
=> You can install packages <b>globally</b> (making them available anywhere on your system) or locally (only within a specific project).
=> Global installations are typically used for command-line tools (e.g., <b>npm install -g webpack</b>), while local installations are for project-specific dependencies (e.g., <b>npm install express</b>).

          text1: `<b> package.json </b>
                    <b>package.json</b> is a <b>configuration file</b> that is essential in any Node.js project. It contains metadata about your project, including its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more. This file is used by npm (Node Package Manager) to manage your project's dependencies and configuration, and it plays a key role in the development, testing, and deployment of a Node.js application.
                    
                    Every project in JavaScript - whether it's Node.js or a browser application - can be scoped as an npm package with its own package information and its <b>package.json</b> job to describe the project.

We can think of <b>package.json</b> as stamped labels on those npm good boxes that our army of Wombats delivers around.

<b>package.json</b> will be generated when <b>npm init</b> is run to initialise a JavaScript/Node.js project, with these basic metadata provided by developers:

<b>name</b>: the name of your JavaScript library/project. It should be a unique identifier (lowercase, with dashes or underscores allowed).
<b>version</b>: the version of your project. Often times, for application development, this field is often neglected as there's no apparent need for versioning opensource libraies. But still, it can come handy as a source of the deployment's version. Defines the version of the project using semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). Helps you track different versions of the project.

<b>^</b>: latest minor release. For example, a <b>^1.0.4</b> specification might install version <b>1.3.0</b> if that's the latest minor version in the <b>1</b> major series.
<b>~</b>: latest patch release. In the same way as <b>^</b> for minor releases, <b>~1.0.4</b> specification might install version <b>1.0.7</b> if that's the latest minor version in the <b>1.0</b> minor series.

<b>description</b>: the project's description
<b>license</b>: the project's license

<b>scripts</b>
<b>package.json</b> also supports a <b>scripts</b> property that can be defined to run command-line tools that are installed in the project's local context. For example, the <b>scripts</b> portion of an npm project can look something like this:

{
  "scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
    "build": "tsc",
    "format": "prettier --write **/*.ts",
    "format-check": "prettier --check **/*.ts",
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.ts",
    "pack": "ncc build",
    "test": "jest",
    "all": "npm run build && npm run format && npm run lint && npm run pack && npm test"
  }
}
with <b>eslint, prettier, ncc, jest</b> not necessarily installed as global executables but rather as local to your project inside <b>node_modules/.bin/.</b>

<b>dependencies</b>:
Lists all the packages (and their versions) your project depends on to run.
These packages are installed when you run <b>npm install</b>

npm install &lt;package-name&gt;

"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.17.1",
  "mongoose": "^5.9.1"
}
  
<b>devDependencies</b>:
Lists the packages needed for development purposes, such as testing libraries, build tools, or transpilers (e.g., Babel, Webpack).
These packages are not required in the production environment and can be installed with the <b>--dev</b> flag.

npm install &lt;package-name&gt; --save-dev

"devDependencies": {
  "mocha": "^8.0.0",
  "chai": "^4.2.0"
}
  

<b>package-lock.json</b>
This file describes the exact versions of the dependencies used in an npm JavaScript project. If <b>package.json</b> is a generic descriptive label, <b>package-lock.json</b> is an ingredient table.

<b>package-lock.json</b> is usually generated by the <b>npm install</b> command, and is also read by our NPM CLI tool to ensure reproduction of build environments for the project with <b>npm ci</b>.


<b>npm install</b>
This is the most commonly used command as we develop JavaScript/Node.js applications nowadays.

By default, <b>npm install &lt;package-name&gt;</b> will install the latest version of a package with the <b>^</b> version sign. An <b>npm install</b> within the context of an npm project will download packages into the project's <b>node_modules</b> folder according to <b>package.json</b> specifications, upgrading the package version (and in turn regenerating <b>package-lock.json</b>) wherever it can based on <b>^</b> and <b>~</b> version matching.

You can specify a global flag <b>-g</b> if you want to install a package in the global context which you can use anywhere across your machine


Here’s a breakdown of the differences between:
npm install &lt;package-name&gt;
npm install &lt;package-name&gt; --save
npm install &lt;package-name&gt; --save-dev

<b>1) npm install &lt;package-name&gt;</b>
This is the most basic form of the <b>npm install</b> command. It installs a package and adds it to your <b>node_modules</b> directory.

Behavior:
By default, as of <b>npm version 5</b> and later, running <b>npm install &lt;package-name&gt;</b> automatically saves the package to the <b>dependencies</b> section of your <b>package.json</b> file.
The package will be installed in the node_modules folder of your project.

<b>2) npm install &lt;package-name&gt; --save</b>
Before <b>npm version 5</b>, you needed to explicitly use the <b>--save</b> flag to add the package to the <b>dependencies</b> section of your <b>package.json</b>. However, <b>in npm version 5 and later</b>, this behavior became the default, so you don't have to use <b>--save</b> anymore.

<b>3) npm install &lt;package-name&gt; --save-dev</b>
The <b>--save-dev</b> flag tells npm that the package is only required during the development of your project, not in production. These packages are typically tools for development (like testing libraries, build tools, or compilers) and aren't needed when running the app in a production environment.

Behavior:
-> The package is installed and saved under the <b>devDependencies</b> section in your <b>package.json</b>.
-> This is useful for tools like testing frameworks, bundlers, and other development tools that are not required in production.

<b>--save-dev</b> installs and adds the entry to the <b>package.json</b> file devDependencies
<b>--no-sav</b>e installs but does not add the entry to the package.json file dependencies
<b>--save-optional</b> installs and adds the entry to the package.json file optionalDependencies
<b>--no-optional</b> will prevent optional dependencies from being installed

NPX is a utility that complements the experience of using packages from the npm registry. 
Since npm version 5.2.0 npx is pre-bundled with npm. So it's pretty much a standard nowadays.
npx is also a CLI tool whose purpose is to make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in the npm registry.

It's now very easy to run any sort of Node.js based executable that you would normally install via npm.
You can run the following command to see if it is already installed for your current npm version:

$ which npx
If it's not, you can install it like this:

$ npm install -g npx

      note: [
        {
          text1: `CORS stands for <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</b>. It is a security mechanism that allows or restricts web applications running at one origin (domain) from making requests for resources hosted on a different origin (domain). CORS is implemented by web browsers to prevent potentially malicious behavior (like cross-site request forgery or data theft) when your website or web application makes requests to a server that is hosted on a different domain.
                    
                    CORS is a security feature created to selectively relax the SOP restrictions and enable controlled access to resources from different domains. CORS rules allow domains to specify which domains can request information from them by adding specific HTTP headers in the response.
                   
                    <b>CORS Headers</b>
There are several important CORS-related headers:

<b>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</b>: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.
Example: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com or Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (which allows all origins).
<b>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</b>: Indicates whether or not the response to the request can expose cookies or authorization headers.
Example: Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.
<b>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</b>: Specifies which HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are allowed when accessing the resource.
Example: Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT.
<b>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</b>: Specifies which headers can be included in the actual request.
Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Custom-Header.
<b>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</b>: Specifies which headers are safe to expose to the browser.
Example: Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length.
<b>Access-Control-Max-Age</b>: Specifies how long the results of a preflight request can be cached by the browser.

                    There are several HTTP headers related to CORS, but we are interested in the two related to the commonly seen vulnerabilities — <b>**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**</b> and <b>**Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**</b>.
               
                    I) <b>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</b>: This header specifies the allowed domains to read the response contents. The value can be either a wildcard character <b>**(*)**</b>, which indicates all domains are allowed, or a comma-separated list of domains.

#All domain are allowed
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <b>*</b>   

#comma-separated list of domains
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <b>example.com, metrics.com</b>    
                

II) <b>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</b>: This header determines whether the domain allows for passing credentials — such as cookies or authorization headers in the cross-origin requests.

The value of the header is either True or False. If the header is set to <b>true</b> the domain allows sending credentials. If it is set to <b>false</b> or not included in the response, then it is not allowed.

#allow passing credenitals in the requests
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

#Disallow passing in the requests
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false

<b>benefits of CORS</b>
<b>1. Enables Cross-Domain Resource Sharing</b>
<b>Benefit</b>: CORS allows resources (APIs, images, data, etc.) to be shared between different origins. This is crucial in modern web applications where data often needs to be fetched from multiple domains.
<b>Example</b>: A front-end application hosted at https://frontend.com can request data from a backend API hosted at https://api.<b>example</b>.com.

<b>2. Improved Security</b>
<b>Benefit</b>: CORS provides a security layer by ensuring that only authorized domains (origins) can access a server's resources. It does this by adding specific headers that indicate which origins are allowed to make requests, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
<b>Example</b>: A server can restrict access to its resources so that only requests coming from trusted domains, such as https://mytrusteddomain.com, are allowed.

<b>3. Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</b>
<b>Benefit</b>: CORS helps mitigate attacks like <b>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</b>. By enforcing restrictions on which domains can access a resource, CORS prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of users, particularly when sensitive data is involved (like submitting a form or modifying user settings).
<b>Example</b>: Without CORS, an attacker could create a malicious site that makes requests to your server on behalf of a user (using their credentials). CORS prevents this by ensuring that only specific trusted origins are allowed.

<b>4) Reduces the Risk of Data Theft </b>: Attackers can use CORS vulnerabilities to steal sensitive data from applications like API keys, SSH keys, Personal identifiable information (PII), or users’ credentials.
<b>Benefit</b>: By restricting cross-origin requests, CORS reduces the risk of data theft or unauthorized access to sensitive data on a server. This is especially important for APIs handling private user data or other sensitive information.
<b>Example</b>: A social media platform can ensure that only specific websites (such as <b>https://app.mysocialapp.com</b>) can access the user's profile information, preventing malicious sites from scraping data.

<b>5) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b>: Attackers can use CORS vulnerabilities to perform XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts into web pages to steal session tokens or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
<b>Remote Code Execution</b> in some cases (StackStorm case)

          text1: `<b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b>
                    All web browsers implement a security model known as the <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b>. It restricts domains from accessing and retrieving data from other domains' resources.
                    The SOP policy helps protect users from malicious scripts that could access their sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.
                    For example, if <b>**business.com**</b> tries to make an HTTP request to <b>**metrics.com**</b>, the browser, by default, will block the request because it comes from a different domain.

As much as the SOP sounds like a proper protection policy, it doesn't scale well in today's technologies that depend on each other for operation. For example, it presents challenges to APIs and microservices which have legitimate use cases for accessing and sharing information between domains.

Because of cases like this, there was a need for a new security mechanism that would allow for cross-domain interactions. It's known as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).`,

      note: [
        {
          text1: `Think of a Buffer as a <b>temporary physical memory space</b> (usually a small chunk of RAM) used to hold data while it’s being moved from one place to another.

          A Buffer is a temporary storage area used to hold <b>binary data</b> (not strings, not JSON).
          Buffer is a raw memory allocation used to handle binary data in Node.js, especially in streams and I/O operations.

          Buffer is a way to store and manipulate binary data in Node.js. Binary data refers to data that consists of binary values, as opposed to text data, which consists of characters and symbols. 

          Buffers provide a flexible and efficient way to store and manipulate binary data in Node.js. Whether you’re working with images, audio, video, or raw data, you’ll find that Buffers are a powerful tool that can help you build high-performance and scalable applications.

          Buffers are similar to arrays of integers but are fixed-length and correspond to raw memory allocations outside the V8 JavaScript engine.

          Buffer in Node.js is a built-in object used to handle and <b>manipulate raw binary data</b>, especially when working with streams, files, or network operations.
• Represents raw memory allocation for binary data
• Used in low-level operations like file systems and networking
• Provides methods for reading and writing binary data

        <b>Key Characteristics</b>
    <b>Fixed Size</b>: Once you create a buffer, you cannot change its length.
    <b>Raw Memory</b>: It stores data outside the V8 JavaScript engine's heap, making it very efficient for heavy I/O tasks.
    <b>Binary-First</b>: It represents data as a sequence of integers, where each integer represents a byte (0–255).
    
    <b>Buffer.alloc(size)</b>	Creates a "clean" buffer filled with zeros. Safe but slightly slower.
<b>Buffer.allocUnsafe(size)</b>	Fast, but contains "old" data from memory. Must be overwritten immediately.
<b>Buffer.from(data)</b>	Converts an existing string, array, or object into a buffer.

🏃 <b>Why do we need them?</b>
In a typical web application, data doesn't arrive all at once. It arrives in chunks (streams).
    <b>The Bucket Analogy</b>: Imagine you are filling a pool with a garden hose. You can't teleport the water instantly. The "bucket" you use to carry water from the hose to the pool is the Buffer. It holds the data until there's enough to process or move to its final destination.

    <b>Why Buffer is needed?</b>
Imagine reading a large file:
You cannot load entire file into memory (bad performance ❌)
Instead, Node reads chunks of data
Each chunk is stored in a Buffer
    
    <b>Common Scenarios</b>:
    <b>Reading Files</b>: When you use fs.readFile, the data returned is often a Buffer.
    <b>Network Requests</b>: Data coming over a socket arrives in pieces that need to be "buffered."
    <b>Image Processing</b>: Manipulating pixels requires direct access to binary bits.
    
    Node.js uses buffers when working with:
->     Files (read/write)
-> Network data (HTTP, TCP)
-> Streams

Where Buffers are used
-> File system (fs)
-> Streams (readable, writable)
-> HTTP requests/responses
-> Image/video processing
-> Crypto operations

Because JavaScript (in browsers) works mainly with strings, Node.js introduced Buffer to handle low-level binary data efficiently.
<b>🔹 1. How JavaScript (in browsers) works</b>
In the browser, JavaScript mainly deals with:
Strings
Objects (JSON)
DOM elements

Example:
let text = "Hello World";
👉 Even if you load data (like from an API), it’s usually:
JSON → converted to object
Text → string
So browser JS is high-level:
You don’t directly deal with raw memory or binary bytes.

<b>🔹 2. What is “binary data”?</b>
Binary data = raw bytes (0s and 1s)

Examples:
Image (JPG, PNG)
Video
Audio
File content
Network packets

Example of binary:
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
👉 This is NOT a string yet.

<b>Browser JavaScript mainly works with strings and high-level data, but Node.js deals with low-level operations like files and network data, which are binary. So Node.js introduced Buffer to efficiently handle raw binary data without converting it into strings.</b>
`,
          code1: `// Create a buffer from a string
const buf = Buffer.from('Hello');

console.log(buf); 
// Output: <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f> (These are Hexadecimal values)

console.log(buf.toString()); 
// Output: 'Hello'

console.log(buf[0]); 
// Output: 72 (The character 'H' in decimal/ASCII)
// 



// -------- 🔹 How to create a Buffer? ------------
// 1. Allocate buffer with size
const buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);

// 2. From string
const buf2 = Buffer.from("Hello");

// 3. From array
const buf3 = Buffer.from([65, 66, 67]);

// ----------- 🔹 Example ------------
const buffer = Buffer.from("Anand");

console.log(buffer); 
// <Buffer 41 6e 61 6e 64>

console.log(buffer.toString()); 
// Anand
👉 Internally stored as hex values (binary representation)

// ---------- 🔹 Important Buffer Methods ----------
1. Convert to string
buffer.toString();

2. Write data
buffer.write("Hi");

3. Length
buffer.length;

4. Copy buffer
buffer.copy(targetBuffer);


// ---------🔹 Real-time Example (File Read) ---------
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('test.txt', (err, data) => {
  console.log(data);          // Buffer
  console.log(data.toString()); // Actual content
});

          In Express.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the <b>request</b> object (<b>req</b>), the <b>response</b> object (<b>res</b>), and the <b>next</b> function in the application's request-response cycle. These functions are executed sequentially and can perform various tasks before the request reaches its final route handler or before a response is sent back to the client. 
                    
                    Middleware in Express refers to functions that process requests before reaching the route handlers. These functions can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. They can perform tasks like authentication, logging, or error handling. Middleware helps separate concerns and manage complex routes efficiently.
                    
                    Middleware in Express are functions that sit between the request and response cycle. They can modify <b>req</b> and <b>res</b>, execute code, end the request-response cycle, or call <b>next()</b> to pass control to the next middleware. They are executed in the order they are defined.
                    
->                     Middleware functions usually have 3 standard params req, res, and next. The first two are objects, the last is a function that will call the next middleware function, if there is one.
-> Usually there is a middleware chain, meaning a chain of functions that are called one after the other, with the last function sending the response back to the browser. So we get the request from the browser, make any modifications and data additions, and then send a response back.
-> You must call next() (unless it’s the last function in the chain) or the request will just hang and eventually timeout. In the browser this will manifest as a really long spinner before a message of “connection timed out” or similar.
-> Any changes you make to req or res will be available in the next middleware function.
-> req and res are unique for each request. Meaning that a user from USA result in a different req object than a user from a European country.

<b>next()</b>: This function is called to pass control to the next middleware in the stack if the current one doesn't end the request-response cycle.

<b>Preventing Request Hanging</b>: If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle (e.g., by sending a response with <b>res.send()</b> or <b>res.json())</b>, it must call <b>next()</b> to ensure the request continues to be processed by subsequent middleware or route handlers. Failure to call next() will leave the request hanging, leading to a timeout for the client. 
<b>Error Handling</b>: next() can also be used to pass errors to Express's error-handling middleware. When <b>next(err)</b> is called with an error object, Express will bypass regular middleware and route handlers and instead invoke error-handling middleware specifically designed to manage and respond to errors.
<b>Skipping Middleware/Routes</b>: While less common, <b>next('route')</b> can be used within a route handler to skip the remaining middleware functions in the current route and move control to the next route handler that matches the request. 

<b>What is next()?</b>
next() is a function that Express provides to <b>move control</b> from one middleware function to the <b>next middleware or route handler</b> in the stack.
If you don’t call next() <b>and don’t send a response</b>, the request will just hang forever.

<b>Think of it like a relay race</b> 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️
Each <b>middleware</b> is a runner with a baton (the request).
To continue the race, the runner must <b>pass the baton</b> → next().
If a runner keeps the baton and doesn’t finish the race (<b>res.send()</b>), the race never ends.

<b>🔹 When you DO need next()</b>
You must call <b>next()</b> if your middleware:
Does some work (like logging, authentication, validation, etc.)
<b>Doesn't send a response</b> itself
Needs to <b>pass control</b> to the next middleware or route handler

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Logging request:", req.method, req.url);
  next(); // ✅ continue to next route
});


<b>When you DON’T need next()</b>
You don't call <b>next()</b> if:
Your handler/middleware <b>already sent a response</b> with res.send, res.json, or res.end.
You intentionally want to <b>end the request here</b>.

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!"); // ✅ no need for next()
});

<b>Middleware (app.use / extra functions)</b> → usually needs <b>next()</b>.
<b>Final route handlers (app.get/post/etc.)</b> → usually end with <b>res.send(...)</b> → no next().
<b>Error-handling middleware</b> uses <b>next(err)</b> (special case).

          text1: `<b>JWT</b>
                    A <b>JSON Web Token</b>, or JWT, is an open standard for securely creating and sending data between two parties, usually a client and a server.
                    
                    JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe token used to represent claims between two parties. It works by encoding a JSON object into a string, which is then signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure its integrity and authenticity.

                    <b>JWT (JSON Web Token)</b> is a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties in a secure manner. It's commonly used for <b>authentication</b> and <b>authorization</b> in modern web applications and APIs. JWT allows for transmitting data as a JSON object, and it can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
                    
                    "JWTs are typically used to represent user identities and ensure secure communication between a client (such as a web or mobile app) and a server. They allow the server to verify the identity of a user, determine whether they are authorized to access a resource, and maintain a stateless authentication mechanism."

                    JWTs are usually used to manage user sessions on a website. While they're an important part of the token based authentication process, JWTs themselves are used for <b>authorization</b>, not <b>authentication</b>.
                    
                    When you sign in to a site with a username and password, or with a third party method like Google, you're proving who you are with those sensitive details or access. This process is called <b>authentication</b>.

Once you're signed in, the site's server sends back a JWT that allows you access to things like your settings page, shopping cart, and so on. This process is called <b>authorization</b>.

JWTs are just bits of encoded JSON data with a cryptographic signature at the end.
Here's an example of a JWT:
<span style="color:red">eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9</span> .eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwI iwibmFtZSI6IlF1aW5jeSBMYXJzb24iLCJ pYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9. <span style="color:#09ca9a">WcPGXClpKD7Bc1C0CCDA1060E2GGlTfamrd8-W0ghBE</span>
Each JWT is made up of three segments, each separated by a dot (.). These three segments are the <b>header</b>, <b>payload</b>, and <b>signature.</b>  
If you copy and paste that JWT into the <a target="_blank" href="https://jwt.io/">JWT.io Debugger</a>, you can see the decoded versions of those three segments. 

A JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts: the <b>header</b>, the <b>payload</b>, and the <b>signature</b>. The header contains metadata about the token and the algorithm used for signing, the payload holds the claims, and the signature ensures the token's integrity.

<b>Header Segment</b>
The header segment of a JWT contains information about the algorithm and token type.

Here's the header segment of the example JWT token above:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
The header segment is base 64 URL encoded, and decodes to the following JSON object:
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
<b>alg</b> is the type of algorithm used in the last segment, the cryptographic signature. In this case, the HMAC SHA256 algorithm is used, though RSA is also common.
<b>typ</b> is the type of token the segmented string is, which in this case is JWT.
<b>What is the purpose of the header in a JWT?</b>
The purpose of the header in a JWT is to contain metadata about the token, including the type of token and the signing algorithm used. This information is crucial for verifying the token's integrity and ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.

<b>Payload Segment</b>
The payload segment of a JWT contains registered claims or identifying information, usually for a user.
Here's the payload segment of the example JWT token above:
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlF1aW5jeSBMYXJzb24iLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9
The payload segment is also base 64 URL encoded, and decodes to the following JSON object:
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "Quincy Larson",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
Since JWTs are usually used as part of the authentication method for sites, the payload segment usually contains identifying information for a user. These claims fall into three categories: registered, public, and private.
Registered claims are a set of predefined claims defined here that are optional, but recommended when using JWTs.
Public clams are optional claims, usually from the IANA JSON Web Token Registry.

Private claims are optional, and are any claims that don't fall under the registered or public claims categories.
<b>iat</b> is the <b>issued at</b> date for the token, and is a registered claim.

<b>Signature Segment</b>
The signature segment of a JWT contains the cryptographic signature of the token.
Here's the signature segment of the example JWT token above:

WcPGXClpKD7Bc1C0CCDA1060E2GGlTfamrd8-W0ghBE
The signature segment is made up of the base 64 URL encoded header and payload segments, a secret (usually the contents of a key in a signing algorithm), and hashed using the algorithm defined in the header segment:

HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  your-256-bit-secret
)
The signature helps ensure that the data in the header and payload segments haven't been tampered with, and the JWT can be trusted.
However, it's important to note that the cryptographic signature at the end of the JWT is just for validation. It doesn't encrypt any data in the header or payload segments of the token. So you should never send sensitive information like a user's password in a JWT – everything in the header and payload can and should be public.`,

        {
          text1: `<b>How do you create a JWT in Node.js?</b>
                    To create a JWT in Node.js, you first need to install the jsonwebtoken library. Then, you can create a payload with the necessary claims and sign the token using a secret key and the sign method.

                    <b>1) Install Necessary Dependencies</b>
npm install jsonwebtoken

<b>2) Create the JWT Token </b>
When the user logs in, you can generate a JWT using the jwt.sign() method from the jsonwebtoken package.
  -> Normally, you'd validate the user credentials here
  const user = {
    id: 1,
    username: 'john_doe',
    role: 'admin',
  };

  The <b>jwt.sign()</b> method takes the following parameters:
<b>Payload</b>: The user's information that you want to store in the token (e.g., user ID, roles).
<b>Secret key</b>: A secret string used to sign the token, which ensures its authenticity and integrity.
<b>Options</b>: Optional parameters such as expiresIn to specify how long the token is valid.

const token = jwt.sign(
    { id: 1, username: 'john_doe', role: 'admin' }, // Payload
    'your-secret-key', // Secret key
    { expiresIn: '1h' } // Options (optional)
);

   payload contains the user's ID, username, and role. The token will expire in 1 hour <b>('1h')</b>.

   <b>3) Send the JWT to the Client</b>
res.json({ token });

<b>4) Verify the JWT on the Server (JWT Payload and Decoding)</b>
jwt.<span style="color:red">verify</span>(token, 'your-secret-key', (err, decoded) => {
  if (err) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    OR
    return res.status(401).send('Token has expired or is invalid');

  console.log(decoded.id);    // User's ID
  console.log(decoded.role);  // User's role (admin, user, etc.)

  res.json({ message: 'Access granted', user: decoded });
});

<b>5) Send the JWT with Subsequent Requests</b>
For any protected resources, the client will send the JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests. The format is usually Bearer <token>.
Example request (in JavaScript for a browser client):

fetch('http://localhost:3000/protected', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': \`Bearer \${token}\`,

})

                    <b>What is Hashing?</b>
Hashing involves converting a given key or string of characters into another value. This is typically represented by a shorter, fixed-length value or key that represents the original value and facilitates the retrieval.

<b>What is Password Hashing?</b>
Password Hashing is a process of converting an input password into a fixed-length string of characters, typically for the purpose of securely storing and transmitting the password.

Password hash functions are designed to be one-way functions. This means it should not be computationally possible to reverse the process and get the original input password from the hashed value.

For example, suppose we want to hash a password like <b>password123</b>. The password will be transformed into a fixed-length character string using a hash algorithm like bcrypt. And we'll get a hashed result once the hash function has processed our password.

The hashed output of <b>password123</b> using <b>bcrypt</b>, for instance, would look like this:
e234dsdom3k2kmdl3l43iwes9vjro44223m3n32kn5n2ksdo4

<b>What is bcrypt?</b>
Bcrypt is a cryptographic algorithm that hashes passwords and creates a fixed-length string (the hash) that represents the original password. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that once a password is hashed, it cannot be easily reversed back to the original password. This makes bcrypt useful for securely storing passwords in databases.

bcrypt is a type of cryptographic algorithm used to securely store passwords. It scrambles a user's password into a unique code. This way, even if a thief takes the database, they won't be able to recover the original passwords readily.

<b>How bcrypt works</b>:
<b>Salting</b>: When you hash a password with bcrypt, it automatically generates a salt and combines it with the password.
To improve security, bcrypt incorporates a random number called a salt. This salt is unique to each password and is attached to it before hashing. The combined value (password + salt) is then passed to the hashing function.
<b>Hashing</b>: Bcrypt then hashes the salted password with the cryptographic algorithm, resulting in a hash that is hard to reverse.
 Bcrypt processes a user's password using a sophisticated mathematical function. This function converts the password to a fixed-length string of characters that appear random and meaningless. The hashed value is what is kept in the database, not the original password. Because the hashing function is one-way, reversing the hash will not produce the original password.
<b>Storing</b>: The resulting hash includes the salt and other information needed to verify the password (the cost factor and the salt itself). So, you don't need to store the original password; you store the hash and the salt.

<b>How bcrypt is used in practice</b>:
When a user logs in, the system compares the hash of the password they input with the stored hash in the database.
<b>Hash the password</b>: When a user registers, bcrypt hashes the password with a salt and stores the hash in the database.
<b>Verification</b>: When a user logs in, the system uses bcrypt to hash the password they provide and compares it to the stored hash in the database. Since bcrypt includes the salt in the hash, it can correctly compare the two without needing the original password.

<b>Benefits of bcrypt</b>:
<b>Security</b>: The salt and adaptive cost factor make bcrypt resistant to common attacks like rainbow table attacks and brute-force attacks.
<b>Automatic salting</b>: Bcrypt automatically handles salting, so you don’t need to worry about managing salts yourself.
<b>Slow and adaptive</b>: The ability to adjust the cost factor makes bcrypt resilient against increasing computational power, allowing you to make it slower as technology improves.

<b>1) bcrypt.hash()</b>: This function is used to generate a hash of a plaintext password. It takes the plaintext password and a salt factor (optional) as input parameters and returns the hashed password asynchronously.
<b>2) bcrypt.compare()</b>: This function is used to compare a plaintext password with its hashed counterpart. It takes the plaintext password and the hashed password as input parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the passwords match.


To begin, we require the bcrypt module in our Node.js application:
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

To ensure the strength of our password hashes, we determine the number of salt rounds. This value dictates the computational cost of hashing and, consequently, the level of security:
const saltRounds = 10; // Typically a value between 10 and 12

With our configuration established, we can generate a salt asynchronously using the <b>bcrypt.genSalt()</b> function. This salt will be unique for each password hash, enhancing security:
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, (err, salt) => {
if (err) {
    // Handle error
    return;
}

// Salt generation successful, proceed to hash the password
});

Once the salt is generated, we combine it with the user's password to compute the hash using the <b>bcrypt.hash()</b> function. This results in a securely hashed password ready for storage:
const userPassword = 'user_password'; // Replace with the actual password
bcrypt.hash(userPassword, salt, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
        // Handle error
        return;
    }

// Hashing successful, 'hash' contains the hashed password
console.log('Hashed password:', hash);
});


<b>How to Verify Passwords</b>
To verify a password using bcrypt, use the <b>bcrypt.compare()</b> function. This function compares a plaintext password provided by the user during login with the hashed password stored in the database.`,
          code1: `// ---------- Hashing a password: -----------
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const password = 'mySuperSecretPassword';
// Hash the password
bcrypt.hash(password, 10, (err, hash) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Hashed password:', hash);
  }
});
Here, 10 is the cost factor (higher values make the hashing process slower and more secure).



//------------- Verifying a password: ------------
const storedHash = '$2a$10$ZQF7xGr69lKmm12k5Iyz9uFsdhrDovw1A4KZGk5WoUoEZTIwLVOee'; // Example hash
const inputPassword = 'mySuperSecretPassword';

// Compare the password entered by the user with the stored hash
bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, storedHash, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error comparing password:', err);
  } else if (result) {
    console.log('Password matches!');
  } else {
    console.log('Password does not match!');
  }

          OAuth (Open Authorization) is an <b>authorization framework</b> that allows one application to access another application’s data <b>on behalf of a user, without sharing the user’s password.</b>

          At its core, OAuth 2.0 is an open-standard authorization framework. It is the industry standard for allowing a website or application to access resources (like your profile data, photos, or contacts) hosted by another service, without the user having to share their password.

          OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol. It allows servers and services, which are not directly integrated, to provide authenticated access to their assets. OAuth uses tokens to share authorization data, without requiring applications to share actual logon credentials. This is known as secure, third-party, delegated authorization.

OAuth allows users to authorize one application to interact with another on their behalf, without giving away their password. Users can also specify exactly which permissions the application should have, which creates transparency and enhances security.

The OAuth framework gives application owners the ability to grant cross-domain access control. It manages authentication and authorization separately, which enables easier interoperability. It supports multiple use-cases, including server-to-server and application-to-server, and can be used in combination with other protocols for more complex user cases.
          
          When you click:
👉 “Login with Google”
Flow:
You don’t give your Google password to the app
You give permission to Google
Google sends a token to the app
The app uses that token to access your data (like email)

🎯 Key Idea
❌ No password sharing
✅ Uses tokens + permissions


<b>1. The 4 Main Roles</b>
To understand the flow, you must know the four "players" involved:
    <b>Resource Owner</b>: You (the user). You own the data.
    <b>Client</b>: The application wanting access (e.g., your Node.js app / React app).
    <b>Resource Server</b>: The API holding the data (e.g., Google Photos or a banking API).
    <b>Authorization Server</b>: The server that verifies your identity and issues the token. The system that authenticates user (Example: Google)

<b>2. The Logical Flow (Abstract)</b>
    <b>Authorization Request</b>: The Client asks the User for permission.
    <b>Authorization Grant</b>: The User says "Yes" (usually by clicking a "Grant Access" button).
    <b>Token Request</b>: The Client shows that "Yes" (the grant) to the Authorization Server.
    <b>Access Token</b>: The Authorization Server gives the Client an Access Token (often a JWT).
    <b>Resource Access</b>: The Client uses that token to talk to the Resource Server and get data.
    <b>Refresh Token</b> : An OAuth Refresh Token is a string that the OAuth client can use to get a new access token without the user's interaction.

<b>3. Why Use OAuth? (Interview Selling Points)</b>
    <b>Security (No Shared Passwords)</b>: The third-party app never sees the user's Google/Facebook password.
    <b>Granular Access (Scopes)</b>: You can grant access to "read-only" email without letting the app "send" emails.
    <b>Revocation</b>: If you lose trust in an app, you can revoke its specific token without having to change your main password.
    <b>Federated Identity</b>: It allows for "Single Sign-On" (SSO), reducing "password fatigue" for users.


    🔄 <b>OAuth Flow (Step-by-step)</b>
<b>Step 1: User clicks login</b>
App → Redirects to Google

<b>Step 2: User gives permission</b>
Google asks:
"Allow this app to access your email?"

<b>Step 3: Google sends authorization code</b>
Google → sends "code" to your backend

<b>Step 4: Backend exchanges code for token</b>
Node.js server → sends code to Google
Google → returns access_token

<b>Step 5: Access user data</b>
App → uses token → fetch user profile

          text1: `<b>Basic Node.js Questions</b>:
-> What is Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine (from Google Chrome) and is event-driven, non-blocking, and designed to build scalable network applications.

-> What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript in the browser?
<b>Answer</b>: Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, on the server-side. Unlike JavaScript in the browser, Node.js can access the file system, network, and other resources on the server. Additionally, Node.js uses the V8 engine, but lacks a built-in DOM like a browser.

-> What are the key features of Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>:
Non-blocking, event-driven I/O
Single-threaded with event looping
Fast and efficient due to the V8 engine
Cross-platform compatibility
Built-in libraries for HTTP, file system, etc.

-> What is npm?
<b>Answer</b>: npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, manage, and share reusable code in the form of packages or libraries.

-> How do you handle exceptions in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: Node.js has try/catch blocks for synchronous code and process.on('uncaughtException') for asynchronous code. However, it is recommended to use proper error handling patterns like callback-based error handling or Promises to catch errors in asynchronous code.

<b>Intermediate Node.js Questions</b>:
-> What is the event loop in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: The event loop is a key part of Node.js's non-blocking I/O model. It continuously checks the event queue for tasks to execute. If there are no tasks to execute, it waits. This allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent requests without blocking the main thread.

-> What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>:
Synchronous code executes line by line, blocking the next line until the current one finishes.
Asynchronous code allows Node.js to handle multiple operations concurrently, executing callbacks once the operation completes, without blocking the rest of the code execution.

-> What are streams in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: Streams are objects that allow reading or writing data in a continuous manner. There are four types of streams in Node.js:
Readable streams: Streams from which data is read (e.g., fs.createReadStream).
Writable streams: Streams to which data is written (e.g., fs.createWriteStream).
Duplex streams: Streams that are both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).
Transform streams: Duplex streams that modify the data as it's read and written (e.g., zlib for compression).

-> Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js.
<b>Answer</b>: Middleware are functions that have access to the request (req), response (res), and the next function in the request-response cycle. Middleware can perform actions like logging, authentication, validation, or modifying the request or response before passing control to the next middleware or route handler.

-> What is the purpose of the require function in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: require is used to import modules, JSON, or files in Node.js. It allows you to include functionality from other files and modules into your current file, enabling code reusability.

<b>Advanced Node.js Questions</b>:
-> What is the difference between process.nextTick(), setImmediate(), and setTimeout() in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>:
process.nextTick() is used to defers the execution of a function until the next event loop cycle. It executes before any I/O events.
setImmediate() is executed on the next iteration of the event loop, after I/O events.
setTimeout() is executed after a specified delay (in milliseconds) and is placed in the timers phase of the event loop.

-> What are Cluster and Worker Threads in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>:
Cluster: A built-in module to take advantage of multi-core systems by creating child processes that share the same server port. Each process runs in its own thread, allowing parallel execution.
Worker Threads: A module that allows JavaScript to run in multiple threads in a single Node.js process, useful for CPU-bound tasks.

-> What is the purpose of the Buffer class in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: The Buffer class is used to handle raw binary data in Node.js. It is especially useful for interacting with binary data like files, streams, and network protocols.

-> How do you implement authentication in a Node.js application?
<b>Answer</b>: Authentication in Node.js is often implemented using techniques like:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Tokens are issued after validating user credentials and used to authenticate subsequent requests.
Session-based authentication: Using cookies and server-side session stores.
OAuth: Used to authenticate users via third-party services like Google, Facebook, etc.

-> Explain the concept of "callback hell" in Node.js and how to avoid it.
<b>Answer</b>: "Callback hell" refers to nested callbacks, where callbacks are embedded inside other callbacks, making the code difficult to read and maintain. It can be avoided by:
Using Promises to manage asynchronous code more clearly.
Using async/await for writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style.

-> What is the EventEmitter class in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: The EventEmitter class allows objects to emit events and listen to those events. It’s commonly used in Node.js for handling events, such as requests in HTTP servers or custom events in applications.


<b>Practical Node.js & Performance Questions</b>:
-> How would you optimize the performance of a Node.js application?
<b>Answer</b>:
Use async/await or Promises to handle asynchronous code efficiently.
Implement load balancing with the Cluster module to utilize multi-core processors.
Cache frequently accessed data using in-memory stores like Redis.
Optimize database queries to reduce latency.
Minimize the use of blocking I/O operations.
Use tools like PM2 to monitor and manage the application in production.

-> How would you handle file uploads in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: You can use libraries like Multer or Busboy for handling multipart/form-data requests, which is commonly used for file uploads. Multer can be configured to store uploaded files on the server, in memory, or directly to cloud storage.

-> What is the role of package.json in a Node.js project?
<b>Answer</b>: The package.json file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, scripts, dependencies, and configuration settings. It’s used by npm to manage and install project dependencies.

-> How would you implement rate limiting in a Node.js application?
<b>Answer</b>: Rate limiting can be implemented using middleware in Express.js to limit the number of requests a client can make in a certain period. Libraries like express-rate-limit can be used for this purpose to prevent abuse or excessive API calls.

Node.js Tools & Libraries Questions:
-> What is PM2 and how is it useful in Node.js applications?
<b>Answer</b>: PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications. It helps with managing, monitoring, and scaling applications in production. It supports clustering, automatic restarts, log management, and performance monitoring.

-> What are some common Node.js libraries used for web development?
<b>Answer</b>:
Express: For building web servers and APIs.
Socket.io: For real-time web applications (e.g., chat).
Mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB databases.
Passport.js: For authentication middleware.
JWT: For token-based authentication.

<b>Miscellaneous Questions</b>:
-> Explain the this keyword in Node.js.
<b>Answer</b>: The value of this depends on the context in which it is used. In Node.js:
In regular functions, this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).
In object methods, this refers to the object the method is called on.
Arrow functions do not bind their own this; they inherit it from the surrounding lexical context.

-> What is the path module used for in Node.js?
<b>Answer</b>: The path module is used for working with and manipulating file and directory paths in a platform-independent way. Common methods include path.join(), path.resolve(), path.extname(), etc.

-> What is CORS, and how would you enable it in a Node.js/Express application?
<b>Answer</b>: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers to control cross-origin requests. You can enable CORS in Node.js by using the cors middleware package in Express.

const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());`,

          text1: `The Event Loop is a fundamental mechanism in Node.js that enables <b>non-blocking, asynchronous I/O operations</b>. Despite JavaScript being single-threaded, the Event Loop allows Node to offload tasks to the system kernel or a thread pool, allowing it to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently without waiting for any single task to finish
          
          
          <b>1. The Single-Threaded Nature</b>
Explain that while the Event Loop itself runs on a single thread (the Main Thread), Node.js uses the Libuv library to handle expensive tasks (like file system access or networking) in the background.

<b>2. Phase-Based Execution</b>
Mention that the loop operates in specific phases. A great "senior-level" detail is knowing the difference between setImmediate() and setTimeout():
    <b>setImmediate()</b>: Designed to execute once the current Poll phase completes (in the Check phase).
    <b>setTimeout()</b>: Executes after a minimum threshold of time has passed (in the Timers phase).

<b>3. Microtasks vs. Macrotasks</b>
This is often where candidates get tripped up. Explain that Microtasks (like <b>process.nextTick()</b> and <b>Promises</b>) are executed immediately after the current operation, before the loop moves to the next phase. Macrotasks (like <b>setTimeout</b> or I/O) are handled within their specific phases.

Essentially, the Event Loop's job is to look at the Call Stack and the Task Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack to be executed.`,

      title: "What is Libuv?",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `In short, Libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based on event loops. It was originally developed specifically for Node.js to handle non-blocking operations, though it's now used by other languages like Julia and Luvit.

          -> Built in C lang -> uses (system kernel) -> has multiple threads

          Libuv is a C library that handles the Event Loop and Asynchronous I/O in Node.js. While the V8 engine executes JavaScript, Libuv is responsible for offloading system tasks (like networking or file system access) to the operating system or its internal thread pool, ensuring Node remains non-blocking.

          While the Event Loop runs on a single thread, Libuv maintains a Thread Pool (by default, 4 threads).

          <b>🔧 What exactly is libuv?</b>
libuv is a C library used by Node.js to handle:
-> Event loop
-> Asynchronous I/O (file, network, etc.)
-> Thread pool
-> System-level operations

🧠 <b>Why Node.js needs libuv?</b>
JavaScript alone cannot:
-> Read files asynchronously
-> Handle network requests efficiently
-> Manage OS-level tasks
👉 So Node.js delegates these tasks to libuv

⚙️ <b>How libuv works (simple flow)</b>
1) Your JS code runs (main thread)
2) When async task comes (like file read / API call):
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> It is sent to libuv
3) libuv:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> Uses <b>OS APIs</b> OR
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> Uses <b>thread pool</b>
4) Once task is done:
Callback is pushed to <b>event loop queue</b>
5) Event loop executes callback

🔁 <b>Example</b>
const fs = require('fs');
console.log("Start");
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  console.log("File Read Done");
});
console.log("End");
<b>Output</b>:
Start
End
File Read Done

👉 <b>Why?</b>
-> readFile is handled by libuv
-> It runs in background
-> Main thread continues execution

🧵 <b>Thread Pool in libuv</b>
libuv has a thread pool (default 4 threads) for:
-> File system operations
-> DNS lookup
-> Some crypto operations

🔑 <b>Key Features of libuv</b>
-> Event Loop implementation
-> Non-blocking I/O
-> Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
-> Thread pool handling
-> Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)

});

      title: "Microtasks (The \`Skip the Line\` Tasks)",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Microtasks have the highest priority. They are executed <b>immediately after the current operation</b> and before the Event Loop moves on to the next phase or even renders the UI.

          <b>Definition</b>:
Microtasks are high-priority asynchronous callbacks that are executed immediately after the currently executing script completes, and before the event loop proceeds to the next phase of macrotasks. They are managed by the microtask queue, which is drained completely before the event loop continues.

    Examples: <b>Promise.then(), Promise.catch(), queueMicrotask()</b>, and in Node.js, <b>process.nextTick()</b> (though <b>nextTick</b> technically sits in its own special "super-priority" queue).
    
<b>1) Position in event loop</b>: Microtasks run between macrotask phases. After any callback finishes, Node.js empties the entire microtask queue before moving to the next event loop phase.
<b>Two types of microtasks in Node.js</b>:
    -> <b>process.nextTick() queue</b> - highest priority, runs before other microtasks
    -> <b>Promise microtask queue</b> - .then(), .catch(), .finally(), await continuations

    <b>Execution order</b>:
Code Current script → process.nextTick() callbacks → Promise callbacks → Next event loop phase
`,
          code1: `// ---------------- Ex : 1 -------------
             setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
   process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
   console.log('sync');
   // Output: sync → nextTick → promise → timeout
   
   // ---------------- Ex : 2 -------------
   console.log(1)
setTimeout(() => console.log(2),0)
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3))

      title: "What is thread pool",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `A thread pool is a group of worker threads that run tasks in the background instead of blocking the main thread.
          The thread pool is a pool of worker threads managed by libuv that Node.js uses to execute expensive, blocking operations off the main JavaScript thread, so the event loop doesn’t get blocked.
          
          

    1) <b>Why it exists</b>: Node.js is single-threaded for JS execution. But operations like file I/O, DNS lookup, crypto, and zlib are blocking. The thread pool handles these in parallel without blocking the main thread.

    2) <b>Default size</b>: 4 threads. You can change it with UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable. Max is 1024.
    
    <b>Changing the Size</b>
You can increase the capacity of your application by changing the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable before the process starts. The maximum size is typically 1024.
Bash

# Example: Setting the pool to 8 threads
export UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8
node app.js

<b>How it Fits in the Architecture</b>
Node.js isn't purely single-threaded. It uses the Event Loop for most tasks, but delegates specific "blocking" operations to the libuv thread pool.
    <b>The Event Loop</b>: Handles non-blocking I/O (like network requests) using the OS kernel.
    <b>The Thread Pool</b>: Handles expensive or blocking tasks that the kernel doesn't provide an asynchronous interface for.

<b>What Tasks Go to the Thread Pool?</b>
Not everything uses the pool. Libuv specifically delegates these four main areas to it:
    <b>File System (fs)</b>: Most file operations (reading, writing, renaming) are synchronous at the OS level, so Node uses the pool to keep them from blocking the Event Loop.
    <b>Cryptography (crypto)</b>: Functions like <b>pbkdf2, scrypt</b>, or <b>randomBytes</b> are CPU-intensive and are offloaded to avoid freezing the app.
    <b>Zlib</b>: Compression and decompression tasks (like <b>gzip</b>) are CPU-heavy and handled here.
    <b>DNS</b>: Specifically <b>dns.lookup()</b>, because it is a synchronous call depending on OS configurations.

    👉 “Thread pool executes blocking tasks in the background <b>asynchronously from JavaScript’s point of view</b>”
    <b>Main thread:</b>
Hey libuv, I need to read file contents but that is a time consuming task. I don't want to block further code from being executed during this time. Can I offload this task to you?

🧠 <b>Conversation (What actually happens)</b>
<b>Main Thread (JavaScript)</b>:
“Hey libuv, I need to read file contents. It’s slow. I don’t want to block execution. Can you handle it?”

<b>libuv</b>:
“Sure 👍 I’ll take this task and send it to my thread pool. You continue executing your code.”

⚙️ <b>Behind the scenes</b>
1) You call:
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  console.log(data);
});

2) Node.js does:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> Sends request to libuv
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> libuv assigns it to a worker thread (thread pool)
3) Meanwhile:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> Main thread keeps running other code (non-blocking ✅)
4) Once file reading is done:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> libuv → pushes callback into callback queue
5) Event Loop checks:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> “Is call stack empty?”
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -> If yes → executes your callback

🔥 <b>So your dialogue becomes:</b>
Main Thread → “Offload this task?”
libuv → “Done. I’ll notify you when finished.”
Event Loop → “Callback ready? Let me execute it.”

💡 <b>Key Concepts in your example</b>
-> <b>libuv</b> → handles async operations (I/O, file, network)
-> <b>Thread Pool</b> → does heavy tasks (like file reading)
-> <b>Event Loop</b> → brings result back to main thread
-> <b>Non-blocking</b> → main thread never waits



🔐 <b>What are Crypto Operations?</b>
Crypto operations are tasks related to:
-> Securing data
-> Encrypting / decrypting
-> Hashing passwords
-> Generating secure keys
👉 In simple words:
“Anything that makes data secure or unreadable without a key”

🔥 <b>Common Crypto Operations in Node.js</b>
<b>1. Hashing (Most common 🔥)</b>
const crypto = require('crypto');

crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update('password123')
  .digest('hex');

👉 Converts data → fixed-length string
👉 Used for:
-> Password storage
-> Data integrity

<b>2. Password Hashing (Heavy task ⚡)</b>
crypto.pbkdf2('password', 'salt', 100000, 64, 'sha512', callback);

👉 Used for:
Secure password storage
👉 This is CPU-intensive → goes to Thread Pool



<b>So where is Thread Pool NOT involved?</b>
Thread pool is NOT used for:
Database queries
HTTP/API calls
Network requests

Because these are:
👉 Already asynchronous at OS level

⚠️ Simple analogy
Thread pool worker = person doing task step-by-step (synchronous)
Main thread = doesn’t wait → continues work (asynchronous)
