            <b>The position Property</b>
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
There are five different position values:
=> static
=> relative
=> fixed
=> absolute
=> sticky

=> <b>static</b>: every element has a static position by default, so the element will stick to the normal page flow. So if there is a left/right/top/bottom/z-index set then there will be no effect on that element.
=> <b>relative</b>: an element's original position remains in the flow of the document, just like the static value. But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work. The positional properties “nudge” the element from the original position in that direction.
=> <b>absolute</b>: the element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements will behave as if it's not even there whilst all the other positional properties will work on it.

=> <b>fixed</b>: the element is removed from the flow of the document like absolutely positioned elements. In fact they behave almost the same, only fixed positioned elements are always relative to the document, not any particular parent, and are unaffected by scrolling.
=> <b>sticky</b>: the element is treated like a relative value until the scroll location of the viewport reaches a specified threshold, at which point the element takes a fixed position where it is told to stick.
=> <b>inherit</b>: the position value doesn't cascade, so this can be used to specifically force it to, and inherit the positioning value from its parent.

The main difference between static or relative and absolute or fixed was the space they take up in the flow of the DOM. Positions static & relative keep their natural space in the flow of the document, while the absolute & fixed don't — their space is removed and they have a floating behavior.

          text1: `<b>Static position</b>
This is the default CSS position applicable to all HTML elements. This position place the HTML elements based on normal document flow. Using this position, top/right/bottom/left properties can not be applicable to elements (ie., static position elements don’t obey top/right/bottom/left properties).

By default, every element in CSS is positioned as static.

This has no special property, it is positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

          text1: `<b>position absolute</b>
          absolute property positions an element relative to the parent or the page if the parent is not set to position: relative;

          An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static.Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the absolutely positioned element does not exist.Absolutely positioned elements can overlap other elements.

          An element with <u>position: absolute;</u> is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
<b>Note</b>: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
          Absolute positioning allows you to <b>place your element precisely where you want it</b>.

Absolute positioning is done <b>relative to the first relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent element</b>. In the case when there is no positioned parent element, the element that has position set to absolute will be positioned related <b>directly to the HTML element (the page itself).</b>

👉 The element is <b>removed from the normal document flow</b>
👉 And it is <b>positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor</b>(not static).

🧠 Key idea (very important)
“Nearest positioned ancestor” = the closest parent element that has <b>position</b> other than <b>static</b> (like <b>relative, absolute, fixed</b>, or <b>sticky</b>)
If no such parent exists 👉 it will position relative to the <b>entire page (body/html)</b>

Key Idea
Element is taken out of layout flow
Other elements behave like it doesn’t exist
You can place it anywhere using top/left/right/bottom

An important thing to keep in mind while using absolute positioning is to make sure it is <b>not overused</b>, otherwise, it can lead to a maintenance nightmare.

The next thing, yet again, is to show an example of absolute positioning.

In the example, the parent element has the position set to relative. Now, when you set the position of the child element to absolute, <b>any additional positioning will be done relative to the parent element</b>. The child element moves relatively to the top of the parent element by 100px and right of the parent element by 40px.

<div class="parent-absolute">
  <div class="child-absolute">I am absolute</div>
</div>  
          `,
          code1: `   &lt;div class=&quot;parent-absolute&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;child-absolute&quot;&gt;I am absolute&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
  
 .parent-absolute {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  background: lightblue;
}

.child-absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;

}`,
        },

          text1: `position-relative
          Relative positioning is the first position type we'll take a look at. This is very similar to static positioning, except that once the positioned element has taken its place in the normal flow, you can then modify its final position, including making it overlap other elements on the page. Go ahead and update the <u>position</u> declaration in your code:

<span style="color:red"> position: relative; </span>
If you save and refresh at this stage, you won't see a change in the result at all. So how do you modify the element's position? You need to use the top, bottom, left, and right properties, which we'll explain in the next section.

<b>Introducing top, bottom, left, and right</b>
<u>top, bottom, left</u>, and <u>right</u> are used alongside <u>position</u> to specify exactly where to move the positioned element to. To try this out, add the following declarations to the .positioned rule in your CSS:

When assigned <b>position: relative</b>, an element follows the render flow of the page, but will be shifted relative to its initial position.

To determine the amount of offset, you set values for the <b>top, right, bottom</b>, and/or <b>left</b> properties. Surrounding elements won’t be affected, but there will be space where the repositioned element would have been (in static positioning).

In this example, I've offset div 2 by 30 pixels down (with the <b>top</b> property) and 30 pixels to the right (using the <b>left</b> property). The repositioned div does not affect the position of surrounding elements.

When using <b>position: relative</b>, the <b>z-index</b> value should be set to <b>auto</b> unless you want to create a new stacking context. Essentially, a new stacking context means you create a new set of layers that will be stacked based on that element.


When you set the position relative to an element, without adding any other positioning attributes (top, bottom, right, left) <b>nothing will happen.</b> When you add position apart from relative, such as left: 20px the element will move 20px to the right from its normal position. Here, you can see that <b>this element is relative to itself</b>. When the element moves, no other element on the layout will be affected.

There is a thing you should keep in mind while setting position - relative to an element limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. This means that any element that is the child of this element can be absolutely positioned within this block.

After this brief explanation, we need to back it up, by showing an example.

In this example, you will see how the relative positioned element moves when its attributes are changed. The first element moves to the <b>left</b> and <b>top</b> from its normal position, while the second element stays in the same place because none of the additional positioning attributes were changed.

          text1: `position fixed
          Fixed Position is a CSS technique that keeps an element in the same place even when the page is scrolled. The syntax for fixed positioning is position: fixed;. To position the element, we use top, right, bottom, and left properties.
          
          The position: fixed property in CSS is used to position an element relative to the viewport, regardless of the scrolling position of the document. When an element is set to position: fixed, it is removed from the normal document flow and remains fixed in the same position within the viewport, even as the user scrolls the page.

          <b>Important Considerations:</b>
=> When using position: fixed, it's essential to specify the top, bottom, left, or right properties to determine the fixed position of the element within the viewport.
=> Fixed elements are removed from the normal document flow, which means they do not affect the layout of other elements on the page.
=> Fixed elements remain visible in the same position, even when the user scrolls the page, providing a consistent user experience.
=> Fixed positioning is supported in all modern browsers, but it's essential to test and ensure compatibility with older browsers if needed.

Elements with <b>position: fixed</b> do not adhere to the normal render flow of the document. Instead, fixed elements are positioned relative to the viewport — in other words, the part of the document that is currently visible in the browser.

Fixed elements do not move when the user scrolls, and, unlike <b>relative</b>, they do not leave a blank space where the element would have been positioned. You can use the <b>top, right, bottom</b>, and <b>left</b> properties to set the fixed element's final position.

Here, div 2 is offset by 30 pixels top and 30 pixels left, like in the last example. However, this time it is positioned relative to the viewport. Notice that there is no space where the element would have been on the page.
          `,
          code1: `&lt;div className=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div className=&quot;box position-fixed&quot; id=&quot;example-element&quot;&gt;position-fixed&lt;/div&gt;

    top: 40px;
    left: 40px;
}`,
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>sticky</b>
          In CSS, the position: sticky property is used to create elements that behave like <b>relative positioning</b> until they reach a certain scroll position, at which point they "stick" to a specific position in the viewport, effectively behaving like <b>fixed positioning</b>.

The key feature of <u>position: sticky</u> is that the element remains <b>relative to its nearest scrollable ancestor</b> until a defined threshold (usually a <u>top, bottom, left, or right</u> value) is reached. Once the threshold is passed during scrolling, the element sticks in place, behaving like a <u>fixed</u> element, but only within its container.

<b>How position: sticky Works</b>:
    => The element starts in the normal document flow, just like <u>position: relative</u>.
    => When the user scrolls the page, the element will <b>stick</b> to a defined position (e.g., top of the screen, bottom of the container) once the scroll position reaches a certain threshold, and it stays "stuck" at that position until its containing block (ancestor) is out of view.


    <b>The Sticky Exploration</b>
While playing with it, I quickly noticed that when an element with a <u>position: sticky</u> style is wrapped, and it is the only element inside the wrapper element, this element, which was defined <u>position: sticky</u> will not stick.

<span style="color:red">&lt;!-- DOESN&#39;T WORK!!! --&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
    .sticky{
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div class=&quot;sticky&quot;&gt;
        SOME CONTENT
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</span>

When I added more elements inside the wrapper element, it started working.

<u>Why is that?</u>
The reason for that is that when an element is given the position: sticky style, the sticky item's container is the only area in which the sticky item can stick. The item doesn't have any elements to float over since it can only float over sibling elements, which, being an only child, it doesn't have.

<b>How CSS Position Sticky Really Works!</b>
CSS position sticky has two main parts, <b>sticky item & sticky container</b>.

<b>Sticky Item </b> — is the element that we defined with the <u>position: sticky</u> styles. The element will float when the viewport position matches the position definition, for example: <u>top: 0px</u>.

<b>Sticky Container</b> —is the HTML element which wraps the <b>sticky item</b>. This is the maximum area that the sticky item can float in.

<b>When you define an element with position: sticky you're automatically defining the parent element as a sticky container!</b>
This is very important to remember! The container is the scope of the sticky item, and the item can't get out of its sticky container.

This is the reason why in the previous example, the sticky item didn't stick in the first place: The sticky item was the only child element in a sticky container.

          code1: `&lt;div className=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          text1: `CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

=> Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
=> Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
=> Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
=> Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
=> Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


<b>The CSS element Selector</b>
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.


<b>The CSS id Selector</b>
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

<b>The CSS class Selector</b>
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

<b>The CSS Universal Selector</b>
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.


<b>The CSS Grouping Selector</b>
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

          color: red;
        }

        // You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
        // In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 
        p.center {
          text-align: center;

        {
          text1: `Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements. They enable you to apply styles to elements based on user interactions, their position in the document, or specific conditions. For example, you can change the style of an element when the user hovers over it, or when a link is visited.
          
          A CSS <b>pseudo-class</b> is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class <b>:hover</b> can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.

          CSS pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements. CSS pseudo-classes allow you to style elements based on their state or position in the document tree.

/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}
  
A pseudo-class consists of a colon (<b>:</b>) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., <b>:hover</b>). A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments (e.g., <b>:dir()</b>). The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element (e.g., <b>button</b> in case <b>button:hover</b>).

Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (<u>:visited</u>, for example), the status of its content (like <u>:checked</u> on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like <u>:hover</u>, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).

=> CSS :hover Pseudo Class
=> CSS :active Pseudo Class
=> CSS :focus Pseudo Class
=> CSS :visited Pseudo Class
=> CSS :not Pseudo Class


<b>1. CSS :hover Pseudo Class</b>
The :hover pseudo-class is used to add special effects to an element when the mouse pointer hovers over it. This is commonly used for buttons and links to enhance interactivity.


<b>2. CSS :active Pseudo Class</b>
The :active pseudo-class applies to an element that is currently being activated by the user, such as when a button is clicked.

<b>3. CSS :focus Pseudo Class</b>
The :focus pseudo-class selects an element that is currently focused by the user, typically used with input fields in forms.

<b>4. CSS :visited Pseudo Class</b>
The :visited pseudo-class is used to select links that the user has already visited, allowing you to style them differently from unvisited links.

<b>5. CSS :not Pseudo Class</b>
The :not() pseudo-class selects elements that do not match a specific selector. This can be useful for applying styles to a group of elements while excluding certain ones.
The :not() pseudo-class is used to exclude certain elements from a set of selectors. It's a way to apply styles to elements except those that match the argument passed inside the :not().

          text1: `The <b>margin: auto;</b> property works to center an element horizontally, but only when certain conditions are met. If it's not working in your case, there could be a few reasons why it's not centering as expected. Here's what to check and correct:

<b>1. Width is Required</b>:
For margin: auto to work and center the element, the element must have a defined width. If no width is set, the element will expand to the width of its parent container, and auto margins won't have an effect.

<b>2. Block Display (default for div)</b>:
The margin: auto works for block-level elements. By default, most elements like &lt;div&gt; are block elements, so this should work without needing any additional properties.
If the element is an inline or inline-block element, you will need to change it to a block-level element or apply other centering techniques.

<b>3. Parent Container</b>:
Ensure the parent container (the element surrounding <b>.main-box</b>) has enough space. If the parent container has limited space, <b>margin: auto;</b> may not work effectively.
If <b>.main-box</b> is inside <b>.parent-container</b>, this can help center it perfectly within the parent.

<b>4. Centering Vertically</b>:
If you want to center the <b>.main-box</b> both horizontally <b>and vertically</b>, you can use <b>flexbox</b> or <b>grid</b>.
Here's how you can use <b>Flexbox</b> to center both horizontally and vertically:

          text1: `The <b>display</b> property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

<b>The display Property</b>
The <b>display</b> property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is <b>block or inline.</b>

The <b>display</b> property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.



<b>Block-level Elements</b>
A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The &lt;div&gt; element is a block-level element.

Examples of block-level elements:
=>  &lt;div&gt;
=>  &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;
=>  &lt;p&gt;
=>  &lt;form&gt;
=>  &lt;header&gt;
=>  &lt;footer&gt;
=>  &lt;section&gt;


<b>Inline Elements</b>
An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline &lt;span&gt; element inside a paragraph.

<b>Examples of inline elements:</b>
&lt;span&gt;

          text1: `<b>Using width, max-width and margin: auto;</b>
As mentioned in the previous chapter; a block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:

This &lt;div&gt; element has a width of 500px, and margin set to auto.

<b>Note</b>: The problem with the &lt;div&gt; above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on small devices:

This &lt;div&gt; element has a max-width of 500px, and margin set to auto.

<b>Tip</b>: Resize the browser window to less than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!

Here is an example of the two divs above:`,

  width: 500px;

When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the <u>clear</u> property.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:

One method for aligning elements is to use <u>position: absolute;</u>

<b>Right align with the position property</b>

<p>An example of how to right align elements with the position property:</p>

<div class="right">
  <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>
</div>
`,

  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;

}
  
// Left and Right Align - Using float
// Another method for aligning elements is to use the float property:
.right {
  float: right;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
  padding: 10px;
}

// Center Vertically - Using padding
There are many ways to center an element vertically in CSS. A simple solution is to use top and bottom "padding":
.center {
  padding: 70px 0;
  border: 3px solid green;
}

// To center both vertically and horizontally, use "padding" and "text-align: center"
.center {
  padding: 70px 0;
  border: 3px solid green;
  text-align: center;
}

// Center Vertically - Using line-height
// Another trick is to use the "line-height" property with a value that is equal to the "height" property:

.center {
  line-height: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid green;
  text-align: center;
}

/* If the text has multiple lines, add the following: */
.center p {
  line-height: 1.5;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}


// Center Vertically - Using position & transform
// If "padding" and "line-height" are not options, another solution is to use positioning and the "transform" property:

.center {
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
  border: 3px solid green;
}

.center p {
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

// Center Vertically - Using Flexbox
// You can also use flexbox to center things. Just note that flexbox is not supported in IE10 and earlier versions:

.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 200px;

The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower the value, the more transparent:

The opacity property is often used together with the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:

          The CSS <u>background-size</u> property allows you to specify the size of background images.

The size can be specified in lengths, percentages, or by using one of the two keywords: contain or cover.

The following example resizes a background image to much smaller than the original image (using pixels):


The two other possible values for <u>background-size</u> are <u>contain</u> and <u>cover</u>.

The <u>contain</u> keyword scales the background image to be as large as possible (but both its width and its height must fit inside the content area). As such, depending on the proportions of the background image and the background positioning area, there may be some areas of the background which are not covered by the background image.

The <u>cover</u> keyword scales the background image so that the content area is completely covered by the background image (both its width and height are equal to or exceed the content area). As such, some parts of the background image may not be visible in the background positioning area.

      note: [
        {
          text1: `CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:
=> Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
=> Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
=> Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)

<b>CSS Linear Gradients</b>
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
<u>background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);</u>

<b>Direction - Top to Bottom (this is default)</b>

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts at the top. It starts red, transitioning to yellow:
<h4>Linear Gradient - Top to Bottom</h4>
<p>This linear gradient starts red at the top, transitioning to yellow at the bottom:</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>
`,
          code1: `&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
#grad1 {
  height: 200px;
  background-color: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Linear Gradient - Top to Bottom&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This linear gradient starts red at the top, transitioning to yellow at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;grad1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

//Direction - Left to Right
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);
}


//--------------------
// Direction - Diagonal
// You can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow);
}
`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Using Angles</b>
If you want more control over the direction of the gradient, you can define an angle, instead of the predefined directions (to bottom, to top, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.). A value of 0deg is equivalent to "to top". A value of 90deg is equivalent to "to right". A value of 180deg is equivalent to "to bottom"


<b>Using Multiple Color Stops</b>
The following example shows a linear gradient (from top to bottom) with multiple color stops:

`,
          code1: `#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);
}
  
//Using Multiple Color Stops
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
  `
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Using Transparency</b>
CSS gradients also support transparency, which can be used to create fading effects.

To add transparency, we use the rgba() function to define the color stops. The last parameter in the rgba() function can be a value from 0 to 1, and it defines the transparency of the color: 0 indicates full transparency, 1 indicates full color (no transparency).

<b>Repeating a linear-gradient</b>
The <u>repeating-linear-gradient()</u> function is used to repeat linear gradients:

  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,0,0,0), rgba(255,0,0,1));

Syntax
<u>background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);</u>
By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.


<b>Use of Different Size Keywords</b>

=> transition-timing-function

<b>How to Use CSS Transitions?</b>
To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

the CSS property you want to add an effect to
the duration of the effect
<b>Note</b>: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

The following example shows a 100px * 100px red &lt;div&gt; element. The &lt;div&gt; element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds:

The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value.
<h4>The transition Property</h4>
<p>Hover over the div element below, to see the transition effect:</p>

          The transition-delay CSS property specifies the duration to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes.
          The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
          The transition-delay property, normally used as part of transition shorthand, is used to define a length of time to delay the start of a transition.
          
    =>       A valid time value defined in seconds or milliseconds e.g. 1.3s or 125ms
    => A comma-separated list of time values, for defining separate delay values on multiple transitions for a single element e.g. 1s background-color, 350ms transform
    The default value for transition-delay is 0s, meaning that no delay will take place and the transition will start to occur immediately. The time value can be expressed as a decimal-based number for more precise timing.
    
    When a transition has a delay value that is negative, it will cause the transition to begin immediately (with no delay), however, the transition will begin partway through the process, as though it had already begun.

          The <b>transition-duration</b> property specifies how many seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms) a transition effect takes to complete.
          
          The value can be one of the following:
=> A valid time value (defined in seconds or milliseconds)
=> A comma-separated list of time values, for transitioning multiple properties on a single element
The default value for transition-duration is 0s, meaning that no transition will take place and the property change will take place immediately, even if the other transition-related properties are defined. The time value can be expressed as a decimal-based number for more precise timing and negative values are not allowed.

          The transition-property property, normally used as part of transition shorthand, is used to define what property, or properties, you want to apply a transition effect to.
          
          The value can be one of the following:

=> A single property name, as in the example above
=> A comma-separated list of property names (shorthand or longhand), for transitioning multiple properties on a single element
=> The keyword none, which indicates that no property will transition
=> The keyword all, which indicates that all properties will transition (the default)
=> When comma separating the values, the property names are essentially mapped to the other transition properties defined (transition-timing-function, transition-duration, and transition-delay). So this means if a comma-separated list of properties includes one or more property names that are invalid, the other properties will still transition, and will map to their intended related transition properties.

A value of <b>none</b> means that no property will transition. Otherwise, a list of properties to be transitioned, or the keyword all which indicates that <b>all</b> properties are to be transitioned, is given.

The <b>transition-property</b> property specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for (the transition effect will start when the specified CSS property changes).

The spec describes this by saying:

“[U]nrecognized or non-animatable properties must be kept in the list to preserve the matching of indices.”

When using a value of none or the universal keywords inherit or initial, these values cannot be used as part of a comma-separated list, otherwise this will result in a syntax error and the entire line will be ignored.

          text1: `<b>transition-timing-function</b> The transition-timing-function property, normally used as part of transition shorthand, is used to define a function that describes how a transition will proceed over its duration, allowing a transition to change speed during its course.
          
          The <b>transition-timing-function</b> CSS property sets how intermediate values are calculated for CSS properties being affected by a transition effect.

          These timing functions are commonly called easing functions, and can be defined using a predefined keyword value, a stepping function, or a cubic Bézier curve.

The predefined keyword values allowed are:
=> ease
=> linear
=> ease-in
=> ease-out
=> ease-in-out
=> step-start
=> step-end
For some values, the effect may not be as obvious unless the transition duration is set to a larger value.

You may specify multiple easing functions; each one will be applied to the corresponding property as specified by the transition-property property, which acts as a <b>transition-property</b> list. If there are fewer easing functions specified than in the transition-property list, the user agent must calculate which value is used by repeating the list of values until there is one for each transition property. If there are more easing functions, the list is truncated to the right size. In both cases, the CSS declaration stays valid.

<b>The CSS object-fit Property</b>
The CSS <b>object-fit</b> property is used to specify how an &lt;img&gt; or &lt;video&gt; should be resized to fit its container.

This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".

<b>fill</b> - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit
<b>contain</b> - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension
<b>cover</b> - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit

-> Pt (point) is a fixed-size unit that is used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch.
