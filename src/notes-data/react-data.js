The process starts when a component needs to update. This is triggered in two scenarios:
    <b>Initial Render</b>: When the application starts (e.g., <b>root.render()</b>).
      -> Browser loads your app (index.html)
      -> React entry point runs:
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
      -> React starts rendering the root component (App)
      -> Component Function Executes
function App() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;
}
React calls the function
This is called the Render Phase (calculation phase)

---> <b>JSX → JavaScript (createElement)</b>
&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt
becomes:
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
👉 React creates Virtual DOM objects
--- > <b>Virtual DOM Created</b>
React builds a tree like:
App
 └── h1
      └── "Hello"

    <b>State Updates</b>: When <b>useState</b> or <b>useReducer</b> is called, React schedules a re-render.

    <b>2. The Render Phase (Internal Logic)</b>
This is where React does the "heavy lifting" without actually touching the screen yet.
    <b>Component Execution</b>: React calls your function component. It generates a tree of JavaScript objects known as the <b>Virtual DOM</b>.
    <b>Diffing (Reconciliation)</b>: * React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one.
        It uses a sophisticated algorithm (Fiber) to identify exactly what changed (e.g., a text string updated or a new list item was added).
        ---> Diffing (Reconciliation)
        If it's first render → no comparison
        If update → React compares:
        Old Virtual DOM
        New Virtual DOM
        👉 Finds what changed
    <b>Result</b>: React produces a list of "effects" or changes that need to be made to the UI.

    <b>3. The Commit Phase (Updating the DOM)</b>
Once React knows exactly what changed, it applies those changes to the browser's DOM.
    Initial Render: React uses the <b>appendChild()</b> DOM API to put all nodes on the screen.
    Updates: React applies the minimum necessary operations (like <b>setAttribute()</b> or <b>textContent = "new"</b>) to make the browser DOM match the latest Virtual DOM.
    React updates only changed elements in real DOM

    <b>4. The Browser Painting</b>
After the Commit phase is finished and the browser DOM has been updated, the browser re-paints the screen. Only at this point does the user see the change.

          text1: `<b>What is module bundler</b> : It is a tool used in web development that processes the multiple JavaScript modules/source files of an application into single file utilized by the browser

          <b>module bundler</b>. A module bundler is a tool in web development that processes multiple JavaScript (and sometimes CSS or other asset) modules and combines them into a single file — or a few optimized, minified, and compressed files — that can be used efficiently by a browser.
Common Module Bundlers:
    <b>Webpack </b> - The most widely used bundler, highly configurable.
    <b>Rollup </b> - Focused on bundling ES6 modules with tree-shaking.
    <b>Parcel </b> - Zero-config bundler, great for quick setups.
    <b>Vite </b> - Uses Rollup under the hood for production builds, with blazing-fast dev server using native ES modules.

     <b> Why Multiple Bundled Files?</b> 
    <b>Code Splitting</b> 
    Breaks the code into smaller chunks (e.g., by route or feature), so the browser only loads what's needed.
    <b>Example</b>:
        main.bundle.js - core app
        dashboard.chunk.js - loaded only on /dashboard
        vendors.bundle.js - third-party libraries (like React)

    <b>Lazy Loading</b> 
    Some files are loaded on-demand (e.g., when a user navigates to a specific page).

    The primary purpose of the bundlers is to organize modules and dependencies in front-end projects, optimize websites performance, and reduce output bundle size

          <b>What is Webpack? </b>
Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It processes your application’s modules and packages them into one or more bundles, often a single bundle.js file, optimizing loading time for browsers.

 <b>Example Output From a Bundler (like Webpack)</b>
dist/
├── index.html
├── main.bundle.js          <-- Your app’s logic
├── vendors.bundle.js       <-- Third-party libraries
├── 456.chunk.js            <-- A dynamically imported module (code split)
├── main.bundle.js.map      <-- Source map (for debugging)

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a <b>Dependency Graph</b> from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

<b>Dependency Graph</b>
Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a dependency. This allows webpack to take non-code assets, such as images or web fonts, and also provide them as dependencies for your application.

At its core, webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the modules in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your index.html file can reference.

App.js --->     |         |
Dashboard.js -> | Bundler | -> bundle.js
About.js --->   |         |

<b> Why Do We Need Webpack? </b>
Developers prefer to work with many small, manageable files, which improves the development experience and code maintainability. However, this modular approach can introduce order-of-operation issues, where a module depends on another that hasn’t yet loaded. Additionally, getting each file from the server would require a HTTP request, and more files mean more requests, this can slow down performance.

It handles not just JavaScript, but also CSS, images, and more, transforming them into a format that's ready for the web.

Setting up Webpack involves organizing your project, installing Webpack, and configuring it according to your needs.

<b>What problem is webpack solving?</b>

Historically when building a JavaScript application, your JavaScript code would be separated by files (these files may or may not have been actual modules). Then in your <b>index.html</b> file, you'd have to include &lt;script&gt; tags to every JavaScript file you had.

Not only was this tedious, but it was also error-prone. There were the obvious issues like typos or forgetting to include a file, but more than that, the order of the &lt;script&gt; tags mattered. If you loaded a script that depended on React before loading the React script, things would break. Because webpack (intelligently) creates a bundle for you, both of those problems go away. You don't have to worry about forgetting a &lt;script&gt; and you don't have to worry about the order.

As we'll soon see, the "module bundling" aspect is just one part of webpack. If needed, you're also able to tell webpack to make certain transformations on your modules before adding them to the bundle. Examples might include transforming SASS/LESS to regular CSS or "modern JavaScript" to ES5 that the browser can understand.

<b>Project Structure</b>
When you start a project with Webpack, it's a good idea to keep your files organized in <b>src</b> and <b>dist</b> folders:
<b>src</b> - This is where all your original code goes before Webpack bundles it. This includes your JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, and more.
<b>dist</b> - After Webpack does its magic, it puts the finished, optimized code here. This is what you'll put on the web.

          Vite is a frontend build tool and development server used to speed up web development, particularly with modern frameworks like React and Vue. It's designed to provide a faster and leaner development experience by leveraging native ES modules and using optimized build processes.
          
          Vite is a powerful build tool and development server designed to speed up modern web development.
          
          Vite is a modern build tool and development server for front-end projects, created by Evan You (the creator of Vue.js). It's designed to be <b>fast, lightweight</b>, and <b>developer-friendly</b>, especially compared to older bundlers like Webpack.
          
          <b>How HMR Works in Vite</b>
          HMR is built into the Vite dev server. Here's the simplified flow:
🧩 <b>Step-by-Step</b>:
    You edit <u>Button.jsx</u>.
    Vite <b>detects the file change</b>.
    It <b>re-processes only that file</b> (using <u>esbuild</u>).
    Vite pushes the new module to the browser via <b>WebSocket</b>.
    The browser's <b>HMR runtime</b> replaces the old module <b>without reloading the page</b>.
    If you're using React, Vite uses <b>React Refresh</b> to preserve component state.
    
    
    ✅ <b>1. Vite Has Smart Defaults </b>
Vite is <b>opinionated</b> — it comes with sensible defaults, which means:
    No need to configure file watching
    No need to manually set up HMR
    No need to set up Babel or TypeScript transformations

It just <b>works out of the box</b>.

⚙️ <b>2. The react() Plugin Adds React-Specific Logic </b>
plugins: [react()],

This line does a <b>lot</b> behind the scenes:
    Adds <b>JSX support</b>
    Injects <b>React Fast Refresh</b> for HMR
    Supports .jsx, .tsx files
    Configures HMR for React components
So even though it looks like one line, this plugin is internally setting up:
    Babel transforms (if needed)
    HMR boundaries
    State-preserving updates

🧪 <b>3. HMR Is Built-In — No Need to Configure It </b>
Vite internally runs its <b>own development server</b> using:
    <b>esbuild</b> for lightning-fast transformation
    <b>WebSocket</b> server for HMR
    <b>Native ES Modules (ESM)</b> for browser delivery

That's why you don't see things like <b>entry, output</b>, or <b>devServer</b> like in Webpack — it's all <b>abstracted.</b>`,
          code1: ``

          text1: ` <b>eslint-plugin-react-refresh vs vite </b>
          
          🧠 <b>Breakdown</b>
✅ <b>Vite</b>:
    Has built-in support for HMR.
    Uses native <b>ES Modules</b> and a <b>WebSocket server</b> to push hot updates.
    Applies HMR to <b>any module </b>(JS, CSS, etc.).

✅ <b><span style="color:red">@vitejs/plugin-react</span></b>:
    Adds <b>React Fast Refresh</b> on top of Vite's HMR.
    Makes HMR React-aware (preserving component state across edits).

✅ <b>eslint-plugin-react-refresh</b>:
    Doesn't provide HMR at all.
    Only adds lint rules to enforce proper component exports, so HMR doesn't break.
    Example: It warns if you write this:

// ⚠️ This can break Fast Refresh
export const value = 42;

🟢 <b>Final Answer</b>:
    HMR is powered by Vite.
    eslint-plugin-react-refresh just helps you write code that plays nicely with React Fast Refresh.

      title: "Hot Module Replacement (HMR)",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `HMR is a feature in modern development tools (like Webpack or Vite) that allows you to update parts of your web app (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) without refreshing the entire page.
          
          When you develop a React app (e.g., using Vite, Webpack, or Next.js), HMR lets you edit a component, and the browser updates just that component without reloading the whole page
          
          Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development.

          Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) is one of the most useful features offered by webpack. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh. This page focuses on <b>implementation</b> while the concepts page gives more details on how it works and why it's useful.

<b>warning </b>
HMR is not intended for use in production, meaning it should only be used in development. See the building for production guide for more information.

<b>Setup</b>
The goals of development and production builds differ greatly. In development, we want strong source mapping and a localhost server with live reloading or hot module replacement. In production, our goals shift to a focus on minified bundles, lighter weight source maps, and optimized assets to improve load time. With this logical separation at hand, we typically recommend writing separate webpack configurations for each environment.

While we will separate the production and development specific bits out, note that we'll still maintain a "common" configuration to keep things DRY. In order to merge these configurations together, we'll use a utility called webpack-merge. With the "common" configuration in place, we won't have to duplicate code within the environment-specific configurations.


<b> About below diagram </b>
✅ <b> Step 1: Developer Edits Code </b>
    You modify a file using a text editor (like <u>App.js</u>).
    This change is saved to the <b>file system</b>.

✅ <b> Step 2: Webpack Detects Change </b>
    The <b>Webpack Compiler</b> watches the file system.
    When it sees a file change, it <b>recompiles only the updated modules</b>, not the whole app.

✅ <b> Step 3: HMR Server Gets the Update </b>
    The <b>HMR Server</b> inside the Webpack Dev Server receives the new compiled module.

✅ <b> Step 4: Push Update to Browser </b>
    The <b>HMR Server</b> sends the updated module to the browser using a <b>WebSocket connection</b>.
    This update is sent in a small package — only the changed code (not the full page).

✅ <b> Step 5: HMR Runtime Updates Code </b>
    In the browser:
        The <b>HMR Runtime</b> is already running inside  <b>bundle.js</b>.
        It <b>swaps out the old module</b> with the new one, live, while the app is running.
        <b>No page reload</b> happens.
        <b>State is preserved</b> (like your React component's state).

🧠 <b> What's Inside Each Box? </b>
📦 <b> Webpack Dev Server </b>
    <b>Bundle Server </b>: Serves the regular files like <b>bundle.js</b>, HTML, etc.
    <b>HMR Server </b>: Manages WebSocket communication and updates modules live.

🧠 <b> Webpack Compiler </b>
    Compiles updated code when files change.
    Works with both HMR Server and Bundle Server.

🌐 <b> Browser </b>
    Loads <b>bundle.js</b>, which includes:
        <b>HMR Runtime</b>: Handles hot updates.
        <b>Your App's JS Code</b>: The actual React components, etc.

          text1: `JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML but allows you to write JavaScript code in a more declarative way, especially when defining UI components in React.js.

                    JSX makes it easier to describe the structure of UI components in a syntax that resembles HTML. While it might look like a template language, JSX is ultimately just syntactic sugar over regular JavaScript. It gets transpiled into JavaScript code that creates and manipulates React elements
                    in JSX, all self-closing tags must be properly closed, unlike regular HTML where you can omit the closing slash.
                    &lt;input&gt;   {/* ❌ ERROR: Self-closing tags must be closed */}
                    &lt;input /&gt;   {/* ✅ Correct */}

                    As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.
                   
                    <b> const element = &lt; h1 &gt; Hello, JSX !&lt; /h1 &gt; </b>
                   
                    In the above example, the syntax <b>&lt; h1 &gt; Hello, JSX !&lt; /h1 &gt;</b> is JSX. It represents a React element (a virtual representation of a DOM element) and is equivalent to the following JavaScript code:
                   
                    <b> const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, JSX!'); </b>
                    <span style="color:#aa1099">
                    Behind the scenes, tools like Babel are used to transpile JSX into regular JavaScript code that uses React.createElement to create React elements. The resulting JavaScript is what actually gets executed in the browser.
                    </span>
                    why can't browser read jsx
                    JSX isn't directly supported by browsers, requiring conversion by tools like Babel to transform JSX into valid JavaScript. This transpilation ensures browsers can interpret and execute the JSX-embedded code in React applications.`,

“In React, I debug using React DevTools to inspect props/state, console logs for flow tracking, browser network tab for API issues, and breakpoints for step-by-step debugging. I also check useEffect dependencies, unnecessary re-renders, and use Redux DevTools when applicable. For production stability, I use error boundaries and linting tools like ESLint and TypeScript.”

<b>1. React Developer Tools (Must know)</b>
This is the first thing you should mention in interviews.
Inspect component tree
Check props and state values
Identify unnecessary re-renders
See context values

<b>5. Network Tab (API debugging)</b>
Use browser DevTools → Network tab:
API request sent or not?
Status code (200, 404, 500)
Response data correct or not
CORS issues

          text1: ` In React, "props" is short for "properties," and it is a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Props are a way to provide input to a React component, allowing it to render dynamically based on the received data.
            They can be single-valued or objects having a set of values that will be passed to components of React during creation by using a naming convention that almost looks similar to HTML-tag attributes. 
            
            Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only values. 
            It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. 
            It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. 
            It is similar to function arguments. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.
            
            Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. 
            Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. 
            These attributes are available in the component as this. props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method.

      note: [
        {
          text1: `In React, a <b>state object</b> refers to an object in a component that holds the local state of that component. The state represents data that can change over time and influences the rendering of the component. The concept of state is fundamental in React and allows components to manage and respond to dynamic user interactions, data fetching, or any other scenario where the UI needs to be updated based on changing values.

                    In class components, the state is typically initialized in the constructor using this.state and updated using the setState method. Here's a simple example:

                    import React, {Component} from 'react';

                    class MyComponent extends Component {
                        constructor(props) {
                        super(props);
                        this.state = {
                            count: 0,
                            message: 'Hello, React!',
                        };
                    }

                    handleClick = () => {
                        this.setState({
                            count: this.state.count + 1,
                            message: 'Button clicked!',
                        });
                    };

                    render() {
                        return (
                            &lt;div&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;{this.state.message}&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Count: {this.state.count}&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                    In functional components, the <b>useState</b> hook is used to create and manage state. The useState hook returns an array where the first element is the current state value, and the second element is a function to update the state. Here's the equivalent example using a functional component:

                    import React, {useState} from 'react';

                    const MyComponent = () => {
                    const [state, setState] = useState({
                        count: 0,
                        message: 'Hello, React!',
                    });

                    const handleClick = () => {
                        setState({
                            count: state.count + 1,
                            message: 'Button clicked!',
                        });
                    };

                        return (
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;{state.message}&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;Count: {state.count}&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        );
                    };

                    export default MyComponent;

                    In both examples, the state object contains properties (count and message in this case), and when the button is clicked, the setState function is used to update the state, triggering a re-render of the component with the new state values.

                    The use of a state object allows components to maintain and manage multiple pieces of data that can change independently. State is crucial for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React applications.`,

Props allow the parent component to pass data down to its child components, enabling communication and customization of child components based on the parent's needs.

                    <b>Functional Components</b>:
                    In functional components, the props object is automatically passed as the first argument to the component's function:

                    import React from 'react';
                    const MyComponent = (props) => {
                    return &lt;div&gt;{props.message}&lt;/div&gt;;
                    };

                    Here, props is an object containing all the properties passed to MyComponent. The component uses props.message to access the specific prop named "message."

                    <b>Class Components</b>:
                    In class components, the props object is accessed through this.props:

                    import React, {Component} from 'react';
                    class MyComponent extends Component {
                        render() {
                            return &lt;div&gt;{this.props.message}&lt;/div&gt;;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    The this.props syntax is used to access the props object within class component methods like render().

                    In this example, the ParentComponent is passing a prop named "message" with the value "Hello from Parent!" to the ChildComponent. The ChildComponent then displays the value of this prop.

                    Props provide a way to make components more dynamic and reusable, as the same component can be used with different sets of data in different parts of the application. The props object is an integral part of the parent-child communication in React.`,

          text1: `Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing down props (properties) through multiple levels of nested components. When a component deep in the component tree needs access to a prop that is originally provided by a parent component, these props have to be passed down through the intermediate components, even if those intermediate components do not use or need the props themselves.

                    Prop drilling can become a challenge in large applications as the component tree grows, and passing down props through multiple levels might make the code harder to maintain. To address this, there are advanced state management solutions in React, such as context API, Redux, or Recoil, which can help manage global or shared state without the need for prop drilling.`,

        {
          text1: `In React, a component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are the building blocks of a React application, and they encapsulate the structure and behavior of a UI element. React applications are typically composed of multiple components that are organized into a hierarchical structure.

                  Components can be classified into two main types:

                  <b>Functional Components</b>:
                  Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions.
                  They are stateless by default, but with the introduction of React hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now use state and other React features previously limited to class components.
                  Functional components are concise, easier to read, and encouraged for simple, stateless UI components.

                  import React from 'react';
                  const MyComponent = () => {
                  return &lt;div&gt;Hello, I&#39;m a functional component!&lt;/div&gt;;
                  };
                  export default MyComponent;

                  <b>Class Components</b>:
                  Class components are defined using ES6 class syntax and extend the React.Component class.
                  They can have local state, lifecycle methods, and instance methods.
                  While functional components with hooks are now the preferred way to define components, class components are still supported in React.

                  import React, {Component} from 'react';
                  class MyComponent extends Component {
                      render() {
                          return &lt;div&gt;Hello, I&#39;m a class component!&lt;/div&gt;;
                      }
                  }
                  export default MyComponent;

                  Key Characteristics of Components:-
                  <b>Reusability</b>:
                  Components are designed to be reusable. You can create a component and use it in multiple parts of your application.
                  <b>Encapsulation</b>:
                  Components encapsulate their functionality and appearance. They can be thought of as self-contained units that can be easily composed to build complex UIs.
                  <b>Composition</b>:
                  React applications are typically built by composing components together to create a tree-like structure. A parent component can contain child components, and those child components can, in turn, contain more child components.
                  <b>State and Props</b>:
                  Components can have local state managed by the component itself. Additionally, they can receive data from parent components through props (properties).
                  <b>Lifecycle Methods</b>:
                  Class components have lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount) that allow developers to perform actions at specific points in the component's lifecycle.
                  <b>Declarative UI</b>:

                  React components describe what the UI should look like at any point in time. This declarative approach makes it easier to understand and reason about the UI.

                  In this example, Header, MainContent, and Footer are components that are composed together to create the overall structure of the App component.`,

                  In React, a class component is a type of component that is defined using ES6 class syntax. Class components are also known as stateful components because they have the ability to manage and maintain local state. They were the primary way of creating components in React before the introduction of functional components and hooks.

                  <u>Functional Components with Hooks</u>:
                  Functional components with hooks have equivalent lifecycle methods using the useEffect hook.
                  The useEffect hook can handle side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or cleanup.

                              };
                          }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs only once after mount

                      return &lt;div&gt;Hello, I&#39;m a functional component!&lt;/div&gt;;
                  };

                  <b>4. Readability and Conciseness</b>:
                  Functional components with hooks are generally considered more readable, concise, and easier to understand.
                  They encourage a more functional programming style and make it easier to reason about the component's behavior.

                  <b>5. Class Inheritance</b>:
                  Class components extend the React.Component class and support class inheritance.
                  Functional components are just functions and don't support class inheritance.

                  <b>6. Best Practices</b>:
                  As of React 16.8, functional components with hooks are the recommended way of writing components in React.
                  They simplify component logic, encourage better code organization, and offer improved performance optimizations.
                  In summary, while class components are still valid and widely used, functional components with hooks have become the standard in modern React development due to their simplicity, readability, and the benefits brought by React Hooks. Functional components are now the preferred choice for writing new components in React.`,

          text1: `<b>HOC, Render Props</b> and now <b>hooks</b> all serve to the same purpose: <u>Share stateful logic between components</u>. There is actually no way to tell which one is better or worst. All depends on your use case.
          <a href="https://deadsimplechat.com/blog/higher-order-componets-in-react/" target="_blank">higher-order-componets-in-react/</a>
          A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

          A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functionality(enhanced behavior). It is mainly used for reusing component logic like authentication, logging, or loading handling.

          We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

          <b>Benefits of Using Higher-Order Components in React</b>
          <b>Reusability</b>: HOCs allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components, which can save time and reduce code duplication.
          <b>Flexibility</b>: HOCs can take additional arguments, which allows you to customize the behavior of the HOC. This makes them a flexible way to add functionality to your components.
          <b>Separation of concerns</b>: HOCs can help separate concerns in your code by encapsulating certain functionality in a separate component. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.
          <b>Composition</b>: HOCs can be composed together to create more complex functionality. This allows you to build up functionality from smaller, reusable pieces.
          Higher-order components can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns in your application such as authentication, error handling, logging, performance tracking, and many other features.

          <span style="color:red">const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent (WrappedComponent);</span>

          <b>HOC can be used for many use cases</b>:
          Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
          Render hijacking.
          State abstraction and manipulation.
          Props manipulation.
                  
                  Key Points About HOCs in React:
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They were commonly used to add cross-cutting concerns like:
=> Authentication checks
=> Data fetching
=> Event listeners
=> State management

<b>Benefits of Higher Order Components</b>
<b>Reusability</b>: HOCs allow you to encapsulate shared functionalities and apply them to multiple components, promoting code reuse.
<b>Separation of Concerns</b>: HOCs help maintain separate responsibilities, enabling your components to focus on their specific tasks.
<b>Code Abstraction</b>: HOCs abstract common logic from components, making them more concise and easier to understand.
<b>Composability</b>: You can combine various HOCs to compose complex functionalities into your components.

          text1: `<b>When to Use HOCs?</b>
You should use HOCs when you need to:
<b>Share reusable logic</b>: For example, logic related to authentication, permissions, or data fetching can be shared across multiple components.
<b>Enhance a component's behavior</b>: You can use an HOC to enhance a component with new props or lifecycle methods.
<b>Separation of concerns</b>: If you want to keep the core functionality of a component separate from concerns like data fetching, authentication, etc.

<b>Why Use HOCs?</b>
<b>Code Reusability</b>: HOCs help in reusing common code across multiple components, which reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.
<b>Component Composition</b>: HOCs allow you to combine different behaviors, creating a composable architecture.
<b>Clean and Organized Code</b>: HOCs make it easier to organize the logic for things like authentication, permissions, or data fetching in a clean, reusable manner.

    (e) => console.log(e.target.value, 5)

    React sets this function as the onChange handler.
So whenever the user types into the input:
➡️ e.target.value (typed text) and 5 are both logged.

<b>When is this useful?</b>
This pattern is great when you need to pass extra arguments to an event handler.

          text1: `<b>Render Props</b>
          A render prop is where a component's prop is assigned a function and this is called in the render method of the component. Calling the function can return a React element or component to render.

          Render Props is a pattern in React for sharing code between components using a prop that is a function. This function returns a React element, which allows you to dynamically render content based on the state or behavior provided by the component using the render prop.

Render props are a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

          Render Props is considered to be an alternative pattern to HoC. The premise of a Render Prop is similar though in that it also creates a parent wrapper that has the reusable state/functions - but it doesn't do this as a wrapper to our component:

          <b>What do render props solve?</b>
=> Reuse code across components when using ES6 classes.
=> The lowest level of indirection - it's clear which component is called and the state is isolated.
=> No naming collision issues for props, state and class methods.
=> No need to deal with boiler code and hoisting static methods.
=> Minor problems:

=> Caution using shouldComponentUpdate as the render prop might close over data it is unaware of.
=> There could also be minor memory issues when defining a closure for every render. But be sure to measure first before making performance changes as it might not be an issue for your app.
=> Another small annoyance is the render props callback is not so neat in JSX as it needs to be wrapped in an expression. Rendering the result of an HOC does look cleaner.

<b>How Render Props Work</b>
The idea is to pass a function as a prop to a component, which the component will call to render its output. Here's a simple breakdown:
    <b>Parent Component</b>: This component holds state or logic and passes a function to its child as a prop.
    <b>Child Component</b>: This component uses the function prop to render whatever it needs based on the parent's state or logic.

    <b>Breakdown of the Example</b>
    <b>MouseTracker Component</b>: This component tracks the mouse position. It has its own state to keep track of the mouse coordinates and updates it whenever the mouse moves.
    <b>Render Prop</b>: The <u>MouseTracker</u> accepts a <u>render</u> prop, which is a function that takes the current mouse position as an argument and returns React elements. This allows the parent component to determine how to display the mouse position.
    <b>App Component</b>: This component uses <u>MouseTracker</u> and provides a function to render the mouse position. It's decoupled from the tracking logic, allowing for greater flexibility.

<b>Benefits of Render Props</b>
    <b>Reusability</b>: You can easily reuse the <u>MouseTracker</u> component in different parts of your application with different render functions.
    <b>Separation of Concerns</b>: Logic for tracking the mouse position is separate from the presentation logic.
    Flexibility</b>: The child component can render whatever it needs based on the data it receives.

<b>Considerations</b>
    <b>Naming</b>: When using render props, it's common to name the prop something like <u>render, children</u>, or a more descriptive name that indicates its purpose.
    <b>Performance</b>: Be mindful of performance, especially when the render function is re-created on every render. This can cause unnecessary re-renders of the child component.

    <u>They don't allow you to use their data outside of the <b>return</b> statement</u>. With the example above, you can't use the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> values in any state variables, <u>useEffect</u> hooks, or any other functions within your component, because it's only accessible within the <u>return</u> statement.

          In ReactJS, <b>lifting state up</b> is a fundamental concept that plays an important role in managing the state efficiently across different components. When building React applications, it is common for multiple components to need access to the same piece of data or state.

In such cases, instead of duplicating the state across multiple components, React allows us to “lift” the state up to a common ancestor.

<b>What Does Lifting State Up Mean in React?</b>
In React, lifting state up refers to the technique of moving a shared state to a common ancestor of the components that need to access or modify it. Instead of maintaining separate state values in each component, the state is kept in the parent component. This parent component then passes the state and any necessary functions as props to its child components.

          <b> &lt;Fragment&gt; </b> 
Wrap elements in &lt;Fragment&gt; to group them together in situations where you need a single element. Grouping elements in Fragment has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag <></> is shorthand for &lt;Fragment&gt; &lt;/Fragment&gt; in most cases.

<b>Props</b> 
optional key: Fragments declared with the explicit &lt;Fragment&gt; syntax may have keys.

<b> Warnings </b> 
If you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can't use the &lt;&gt;...&lt;/&gt; syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render &lt;Fragment key={yourKey}&gt;...&lt;/Fragment&gt;.

React does not reset state when you go from rendering &lt;&gt;&lt;Child /&gt;&lt;/&gt; to [&lt;Child /&gt;]  or back, or when you go from rendering &lt;&gt;&lt;Child /&gt;&lt;/&gt; to &lt;Child /&gt; and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;Child /&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt; to &lt;Child /&gt; resets the state. See the precise semantics here.

<b>Returning multiple elements </b>
Use Fragment, or the equivalent &lt;&gt;...&lt;/&gt; syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group:

Fragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element. If you inspect this example with the browser tools, you'll see that all &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;article&gt; DOM nodes appear as siblings without wrappers around them:

In React, fragments are a way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This can be useful for returning multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in an unnecessary <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> or other HTML element.
Why Use Fragments?

    <b>Avoid Unnecessary Markup</b>: Fragments help keep the DOM clean by preventing extra elements that don't serve any purpose.
    <b>Grouping Elements</b>: They allow you to group a list of children without adding additional nodes, which can be useful for styling and layout.
    <b>Performance</b>: Reducing the number of unnecessary nodes can slightly improve performance, especially in large applications.

<b>Props</b> 
<u>id</u>: A string identifying the part of the UI you are measuring.
<u>onRender</u>: An onRender callback that React calls every time components within the profiled tree update. It receives information about what was rendered and how much time it took.
<b>Caveats </b>
Profiling adds some additional overhead, so <b>it is disabled in the production build by default</b>. To opt into production profiling, you need to enable a <u>special production build with profiling enabled</u>.

React will call your onRender callback with information about what was rendered.

function onRender(id, phase, actualDuration, baseDuration, startTime, commitTime) {

}</span>

<b>Parameters </b>
<u>id</u>: The string id prop of the &lt;Profiler&gt; tree that has just committed. This lets you identify which part of the tree was committed if you are using multiple profilers.
<u>phase</u>: <u>mount</u>, <u>update</u> or <u>nested-update</u>. This lets you know whether the tree has just been mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to a change in props, state, or Hooks.
<u>actualDuration</u>: The number of milliseconds spent rendering the &lt;Profiler&gt; and its descendants for the current update. This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization <u>(e.g. memo and useMemo)</u>. Ideally this value should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props change.
<u>baseDuration</u>: The number of milliseconds estimating how much time it would take to re-render the entire &lt;Profiler&gt; subtree without any optimizations. It is calculated by summing up the most recent render durations of each component in the tree. This value estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a tree with no memoization). Compare <u>actualDuration</u> against it to see if memoization is working.
<u>startTime</u>: A numeric timestamp for when React began rendering the current update.
<u>commitTime</u>: A numeric timestamp for when React committed the current update. This value is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to be grouped if desirable.

          StrictMode is a development mode feature in React that helps identify common problems in your application and supports you in fixing them. It performs additional checks and warnings to aid developers in writing better code and finding potential issues.
          &lt;StrictMode&gt; lets you find common bugs in your components early during development.

          Strict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the &lt;StrictMode&gt; component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.
          We recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.

Although the Strict Mode checks <b>only run in development</b>, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.

To enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with <StrictMode> when you render it:
          `,
          code1: `import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (<u>props, state</u>, and <u>context</u>).

Components breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) <b>twice in development</b>. This includes:

=> Your component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn't include code inside event handlers)
=> Functions that you pass to <b>useState, set functions, useMemo</b>, or <b>useReducer</b>
=> Some class component methods like <b>constructor, render, shouldComponentUpdate</b> (see the whole list)
If a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that's what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.`,

          text1: `<b>Fixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development </b>
Strict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects.

Every Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.

When Strict Mode is on, React will also run <b>one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect.</b> This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.

<b>Here is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.</b>

To make the issue more obvious, let's implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:

You'll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function:
<span style="color:red">
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);
</span>
Now that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you've added more features (the select box).

With Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn't destroy it. This is a hint that you're missing a cleanup function.

Strict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:
`,
          code1: `// ChatRoom.js

  &lt;SomeComponent /&gt;
&lt;/Suspense&gt;</span>

React Suspense is a major addition to the React ecosystem. It provides a simpler, integrated method of managing asynchronous actions and loading states.

<b> Props </b>
<b>children</b>: The actual UI you intend to render. If <u>children</u> suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering <u>fallback</u>.
<b>fallback</b>: An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to <u>fallback</u> when <u>children</u> suspends, and back to <u>children</u> when the data is ready. If <u>fallback</u> suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary.

<b>Caveats </b>
=> React does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch.
=> If Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition" target="_blank">startTransition</a> or <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue" target="_blank">useDeferredValue</a>.
=> If React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect" target="_blank">layout Effects</a> in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don't try to do this while the content is hidden.
=> React includes under-the-hood optimizations like Streaming Server Rendering and Selective Hydration that are integrated with Suspense. Read an architectural overview and watch a technical talk to learn more.

React will display your <u>loading fallback</u> until all the code and data needed by the <u>children</u> has been loaded.

<b>Note</b>
<b>Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component</b>. They include:

=> Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js
=> Lazy-loading component code with <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy" target="_blank">lazy</a>
=> Reading the value of a Promise with <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/use" target="_blank">use</a>

Suspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.

The exact way you would load data in the Albums component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you'll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Suspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.

// Components that load data don't have to be direct children of the Suspense boundary. For example, you can move "Biography" and "Albums" into a new "Details" component.

        {
          text1: `<b>Revealing nested content as it loads</b>
          When a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense component shows the fallback. This lets you nest multiple Suspense components to create a loading sequence. Each Suspense boundary's fallback will be filled in as the next level of content becomes available. For example, you can give the album list its own fallback:

          With this change, displaying the <b>Biography</b> doesn't need to “wait” for the <b>Albums</b> to load.

The sequence will be:
1) If <b>Biography</b> hasn't loaded yet, <b>BigSpinner</b> is shown in place of the entire content area.
2) Once <b>Biography</b> finishes loading, <b>BigSpinner</b> is replaced by the content.
3) If <b>Albums</b> hasn't loaded yet, <b>AlbumsGlimmer</b> is shown in place of <b>Albums</b> and its <b>parent</b> Panel.
4) Finally, once <b>Albums</b> finishes loading, it replaces <b>AlbumsGlimmer</b>.

Suspense boundaries let you coordinate which parts of your UI should always “pop in” together at the same time, and which parts should progressively reveal more content in a sequence of loading states. You can add, move, or delete Suspense boundaries in any place in the tree without affecting the rest of your app's behavior.

Don't put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience. If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it's likely that they've already included them in their design wireframes.`,

        {
          text1: `The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.
                    The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.

                    Reconciliation:-
                    Reconciliation in React.js is the process of efficiently updating the user interface to reflect changes in the application state. When the state of a React component changes, React needs to update the actual DOM to reflect those changes. The reconciliation process involves comparing the new Virtual DOM representation of the UI with the previous one and determining the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM.

                    Here are the key steps in the reconciliation process:

                    <b>1)Rendering</b>:
                    =>When a React component's state or props change, the component is re-rendered.
                    =>During the re-render, the component returns a new Virtual DOM representation of its UI.

                    <b>2)Virtual DOM Comparison</b>:
                    =>React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous snapshot of the Virtual DOM.
                    =>It identifies the differences (diffs) between the new and old Virtual DOM. This process is often referred to as the "diffing algorithm."

                    <b>3)Reconciliation Algorithm</b>:
                    =>React uses a reconciliation algorithm to efficiently determine how to update the real DOM based on the identified differences.
                    =>The algorithm aims to minimize the number of manipulations needed in the actual DOM, optimizing the update process.

                    <b>4)Updating the DOM</b>:
                    =>After determining the differences, React applies the changes to the real DOM.
                    =>React updates only the parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire DOM.

                    <b>5)Component Lifecycle Methods</b>:
                    =>During the reconciliation process, React invokes specific lifecycle methods on the components, allowing them to perform actions at different stages of the update cycle.
                    =>For example, the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method is called after the component has been updated in the DOM.
                    
                    
                    
                    The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. Instead of interacting directly with the real DOM, which can be slow and costly in terms of performance, React creates a virtual representation of the UI components. This virtual representation is a lightweight JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.

Here's a step-by-step process of how the virtual DOM works:
<b>Step 1 </b>– Initial Rendering: when the app starts, the entire UI is represented as a Virtual DOM. React elements are created and rendered into the virtual structure.
<b>Step 2 </b>– State and Props Changes: as the states and props change in the app, React re-renders the affected components in the virtual DOM. These changes do not immediately impact the real DOM.
<b>Step 3 </b>– Comparison Using Diff Algorithm: React then uses a diffing algorithm to compare the current version of the Virtual DOM with the previous version. This process identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two versions.
<b>Step 4 </b>– Reconciliation Process: based on the differences identified, React determines the most efficient way to update the real DOM. Only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This selective updating is quick and performant.
<b>Step 5 </b>– Update to the Real DOM: finally, React applies the necessary changes to the real DOM. This might involve adding, removing, or updating elements based on the differences detected in step 3.`,

      title: "Explain what the Shadow DOM is.",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `The Shadow DOM, or Shadow Document Object Model, is a web standard that provides encapsulation for the styling and structure of a web component. It allows developers to create and use self-contained components with their own scoped styles, preventing style leakage and conflicts with the styles of the rest of the document.

          Shadow DOM is a web standard designed to encapsulate components' structure, style, and behavior, allowing for more modular and reusable code. In this blog, we'll explore the fundamentals of Shadow DOM, its role within the React ecosystem, and how it can be leveraged to enhance component encapsulation and isolation.

          <b>Understanding the Shadow DOM</b>
The Shadow DOM is a crucial concept in web development, particularly when building complex, large-scale applications. It allows developers to attach a hidden, separate DOM to an element, which is referred to as the shadow host. The DOM tree inside this shadow host is called a shadow tree, and it is not directly visible to the outer DOM or affected by its styles and scripts.

One of the key features of the Shadow DOM is its ability to create a shadow boundary. This boundary ensures that the styles defined inside the shadow tree do not leak out and styles from the main document do not interfere with the content inside the shadow tree. This encapsulation makes the Shadow DOM a powerful tool for web component development.

                    Here are key concepts and features of the Shadow DOM:
                    <b>Encapsulation</b>:
                    The Shadow DOM encapsulates the styles and markup of a component, making it isolated from the rest of the document. This encapsulation helps prevent styles or scripts in the component from affecting the global styles and scripts, and vice versa.

                    <b>Scoped Styles</b>:
                    Styles defined within the Shadow DOM are scoped to the component. They do not leak out to the surrounding document, and styles from the document do not penetrate into the Shadow DOM. This allows developers to write styles without worrying about unintentional global effects.

                    <b>Composition</b>:
                    Components with Shadow DOM can be composed and reused without concern for naming conflicts or style collisions. Each instance of a component with Shadow DOM operates independently, contributing to improved modularity and maintainability.

                    <b>Isolation of JavaScript</b>:
                    JavaScript running inside the Shadow DOM is isolated from the global JavaScript context. This means that variables, functions, or scripts defined within the Shadow DOM do not interfere with the global scope, and vice versa.

                    <b>Creating Shadow DOM</b>:
                    The Shadow DOM is created using the attachShadow method. In the context of web components, this method is typically called within the constructor of a custom element.

                    <b>Accessing the Shadow DOM</b>:
                    Outside code can access the Shadow DOM using the shadowRoot property of an element with Shadow DOM. However, direct manipulation of the Shadow DOM from outside the component is discouraged for the sake of encapsulation.

                    const myComponent = document.querySelector('my-component');
                    const shadowRoot = myComponent.shadowRoot;

                    The Shadow DOM is a crucial feature for building reusable, encapsulated components in web development. It enhances the modularity and maintainability of web applications by providing a way to create components with encapsulated styles and structure. The Shadow DOM is commonly used in conjunction with custom elements and web components.

                    <b>The benefits of using shadow DOM for encapsulation include</b>:
<b>Style Scoping</b>: Styles defined inside a shadow DOM do not affect anything outside of it, preventing unexpected styling issues.
<b>DOM Isolation</b>: The shadow DOM's content is not affected by changes in the global DOM, reducing the risk of conflicts.
<b>Reusability</b>: Components with encapsulated styles and behavior are easier to share across different parts of an application or even different projects.

<b>Purpose</b>
<u>Virtual DOM</u>: Primarily aimed at improving performance by minimizing the number of DOM manipulations required during updates.
<u>Shadow DOM</u>: Focuses on encapsulating the style and behavior of web components, providing a scoped environment for CSS and JavaScript.

<b>Implementation</b>
<u>Virtual DOM</u>: Implemented by libraries/frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular to facilitate efficient updates of the real DOM.
<u>Shadow DOM</u>: Implemented natively by web browsers to support encapsulation of web components with Shadow DOM.

<b>Performance</b>
<u>Virtual DOM</u>: Offers performance benefits by reducing the number of DOM manipulations, resulting in faster updates and rendering.
<u>Shadow DOM</u>: While Shadow DOM itself doesn't directly impact performance, it can enhance performance by isolating component styles and behavior.

<b>Isolation</b>
<u>Virtual DOM</u>: Doesn't provide isolation by itself but helps in minimizing unintended side effects of DOM updates through its efficient diffing algorithm.
<u>Shadow DOM</u>: Provides encapsulation and isolation for the content of web components, preventing style and behavior leakage to the rest of the document.

<b>Usage</b>
<u>Virtual DOM</u>: Commonly used in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, where components are re-rendered efficiently based on state changes.
<u>Shadow DOM</u>: Utilized when creating custom web components with encapsulated styles and behavior, ensuring modularity and reusability.

Here's a breakdown:
<b>What it is</b>:
The children prop is a way to make components more flexible and reusable.
It allows a parent component to inject arbitrary content (HTML elements, other React components, or even text) into a child component.
This is particularly useful for creating "wrapper" components that provide a consistent layout or structure.

<b>How it works</b>:
When you place content between the opening and closing tags of a component in JSX, that content becomes the value of the children prop within that component.
Inside the child component, you can access this content using props.children.
          
<b>Conditionally rendering children</b>(Ex : 2)
You can also conditionally render children based on the parent component's state or props. This is useful when you want to create a component that can be customized based on user input or other factors.

          <b>Using the FC type</b>)(Ex : 3)
There is a standard React type, FC, that we can use on arrow function components. FC stands for Function Component, and it aliases a type called FunctionComponent.

          Yes, index is unique in that render, but the problem is:
👉 it is NOT stable across renders

🧠 Why index as key is risky
React uses key to:
👉 identify which item changed
👉 reuse DOM efficiently
👉 avoid unnecessary re-render or wrong updates

❌ Problem with index as key
1. ⚠️ Keys change when list changes

Example:
items = ["A", "B", "C"]

Keys:
A → 0  
B → 1  
C → 2

Now you insert “X” at top:
items = ["X", "A", "B", "C"]
Keys become:

X → 0  
A → 1  
B → 2  
C → 3

👉 Everything shifted ❌
🚨 React gets confused
React thinks:

“A” at index 1 is NEW element
so it may:
re-render wrongly
lose input state
reset component state
❌ 2. State bugs in UI

Imagine input list:
items.map((item, index) => (
  &lt;input key={index} value={item.value} /&gt;
))

👉 If you insert/delete item:
inputs shift position
values appear in wrong rows 😨
❌ 3. Breaks component identity

React relies on key to preserve:
component state
DOM state
focus position

Using index:
👉 destroys identity when list order changes

✅ Correct Approach

👉 Always use unique stable ID

items.map(item => (

        {
          text1: `Every JSX element has a <b>style</b> property you can add to its opening tag. This means you can add inline styling to JSX in a React component like in traditional HTML.

The primary difference is that you must specify inline styles as objects. In this object, the keys are the CSS properties written in camelCase, and the values are strings corresponding to valid CSS values.
The syntax for inline styles in React is a bit different from regular CSS. Instead of using kebab-case and strings, you use camelCase and values often represented as strings or numbers. For example, a CSS rule like font-size: 12px; would translate to { fontSize: 12 } in React's inline style syntax.
<b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b>
Using inline styles comes with its set of advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, it allows for quick styling and easy dynamic changes based on component state or props. However, it can lead to code redundancy and difficulties in maintaining styles for large projects.

<b>Rule of Thumb</b>
The official React documentation frowns upon the use of inline styling as a primary means of styling projects and recommends the use of the <b>className</b> attribute instead.

<b>Note</b>: Some examples in the documentation use <u>style</u> for convenience, but using the <u>style</u> attribute as the primary means of styling elements is generally not recommended. In most cases, <u>className</u> should be used to reference classes defined in an external CSS stylesheet. style is most often used in React apps to add dynamically computed styles at render time.

useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.

As stated previously, <b>useState</b> enables you to add state to function components. Calling React.useState inside a function component generates a single piece of state associated with that component.

Whereas the <b>state in a class</b> is always an <b>object</b>, with Hooks, the state can be any type. Each piece of state holds a single value: an object, an array, a Boolean, or any other type you can imagine.

<b>useState</b> returns an array where the first item is the getter and the second item is the setter. useState can also take an initial state by passing your desired value as the params. It is a common practice to prefix the setter with set followed by the state name like the example above.

          text1: `<b>Side Effect</b>
                  <a href="https://www.geekster.in/articles/api-calling-with-useeffect/#:~:text=The%20useEffect()%20hook%20is,API%20endpoint%20using%20fetch()%20." target="_blank">useEffect</a>
                    Most React components are <a href="./javascript-notes.html#pure functions">pure functions</a>, meaning they receive an input and produce a predictable output of JSX.

                    In React.js, a side effect refers to any operation that interacts with the outside world or has an impact beyond the component itself. This includes operations such as:

    <b>Data fetching</b>: Making API calls to retrieve or send data.
    <b>Direct DOM manipulation</b>: Changing elements or attributes directly, rather than using React's declarative approach.
    <b>ubscriptions</b>: Setting up listeners or subscriptions to external data sources.
    <b>Timers</b>: Using functions like <u>setTimeout</u> or <u>setInterval</u> to schedule tasks.
    <b>Logging</b>: Writing to the console or other external systems for debugging purposes.

To handle side effects in React, you use the <u>useEffect</u> hook (or <u>componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate</u>, and <u>componentWillUnmount</u> lifecycle methods in class components). The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components and gives you a way to clean up after the effects when the component unmounts or when dependencies change.
                    
                    In React, <b>side effects</b> refer to any operations or behaviors that occur in a component after rendering, and that don't directly impact the current component render cycle. These side effects can include tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM, or other interactions with the outside world.

                    The useEffect hook in React is used to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, or any operation that needs to be performed after the component has been rendered to the screen.

                    The typical use case for useEffect is to manage asynchronous or non-blocking code within a functional component. It allows you to perform actions that are not directly related to rendering but are necessary for the component's behavior.

                    <b>1)Asynchronous Execution</b>:
                    The function passed to useEffect runs asynchronously after the render cycle. It does not block the rendering of the component.

                    <b>2)Dependencies Array</b>:
                    The second parameter is an array of dependencies. If any of these dependencies change between renders, the useEffect function will run again. If the dependencies array is empty, the useEffect will only run once after the initial render.
                   <u> Mounting Phase</u>:
<b>Initialisation</b>: useEffect with an empty dependency array runs once after the initial render. It simulates <b>componentDidMount</b> in class components.
<u>Effect Runs on Every Render</u>: Since there is no dependency array, the effect function provided to useEffect will execute after every render of the component. This can be useful for operations that need to occur on every update, but it may lead to performance issues if the effect involves expensive operations or if it causes additional renders.
If you do not pass a dependency array to the useEffect hook, it will execute the effect after every render of the component. This is because the effect does not have a specified dependency array, meaning it will run every time the component updates.
An empty dependency array ([]) the effect will only run once after the initial render and not on any subsequent renders.

<u>1. Skipping the argument</u>:
We may skip passing the second argument. If we choose to do so then our hook will trigger the callback function on each re-render of the component. Any unrelated state change will trigger the callback function to execute inducing bugs, and compromising performance.
<span style="color:red">
useEffect(() => {
    // Runs in each re-render of the component
})
</span>
<u>2. Empty Array ( [] )</u>
An empty array simply means that there are no dependencies that will trigger the callback within it. Our code inside the callback will run once when the component gets registered, and that is it. The useEffect hook acts like componentDidMount method if an empty array is passed as the dependency array.
<span style="color:red">
useEffect(() => {
    // Runs only when the component is registered
}, [])
</span>
<u>3. Array of dependencies ( [variable1, variable2] )</u>
This might be the most common form used with useEffect. We pass an array filled with all the dependencies that should trigger the callback function to run. Change in any of the variable in the list will execute the callback.

Often these include the states that have been created using useState hook.
<span style="color:red">
const [x, setX] = useState();
const [y, setY] = useState();
useEffect(() => {
    // Runs if x or y changes
}, [x, y])
</span>
                    <b>3)Cleanup Function</b>:
                    The function returned inside useEffect can be used for cleanup. It will be invoked when the component is about to unmount or when the dependencies specified in the array change.
                    
                    <b>4)Common Use Cases</b>:
                    Fetching data from an API.
                    Subscribing to external data sources (e.g., websockets).
                    Manually changing the DOM or interacting with external libraries.

                    One thing to keep in mind is that useEffect only runs after React renders your component, so your effect callback will not prevent browser painting. This is different from how class components behave

                    Here is the basic syntax of the useEffect hook:
`,
          code1: `useEffect(() => {
                    // Side effect code here
                    
                    return () => {
                                // Cleanup code (optional)
                            };
                    }, [dependencies]);
                    //-------------

                    // The first argument is a function that contains the code for the side effect.
                    // The second argument is an array of dependencies. If any of the dependencies change between renders, the effect is re-run. If the array is empty, the effect runs only once (similar to componentDidMount in class components).

                    // Example: Fetching Data
                    import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
    
                    const ExampleComponent = () => {
                    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
                    
                    useEffect(() => {
                        const fetchData = async () => {
                        try {
                            const response = await fetch(\`https://api.example.com/data\`);
                                    const result = await response.json();
                                    setData(result);
                        } catch (error) {
                                        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);

                    }, []); // Empty dependency array means run the effect once on mount

                                    return &lt;p&gt;Data: {data}&lt;/p&gt;;
                    };
                   
                    // In this example, the useEffect hook is used to fetch data from an API. The effect runs once when the component mounts (due to the empty dependency array), and it updates the data state when the fetch is successful.

                    useEffect(() => {
                    const subscription = externalService.subscribe(data => {

                    return () => {
                        // Cleanup: Unsubscribe when the component unmounts or when dependencies change
                        subscription.unsubscribe();
                    };
                    }, [dependencies]);`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Cleanup</b>:-
                    If the effect involves any cleanup, such as unsubscribing from a subscription or clearing a timer, you can return a cleanup function. This cleanup function will be executed when the component is unmounted or when the dependencies change and the effect is re-run.
                    
                    This is where the useEffect cleanup function comes in. The cleanup function is a function that is called when the component is unmounted (i.e., when it is no longer being rendered). It allows you to perform any necessary cleanup tasks, such as cancelling an ongoing API request.
To use the cleanup function, you can pass it as a return value from the useEffect hook. For example:
                    `,
          code1: `useEffect(() => {
  // actions performed when component mounts
  return () => {
    // actions to be performed when component unmounts
  }
}, []);

//--------

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    // do something with the response
  };
  fetchData();
  return () => {
    // cleanup function goes here
  };
}, [url]);

// In this example, the 'fetchData' function is called when the component is rendered. When the component is unmounted, the cleanup function is called, allowing you to cancel the ongoing fetch request if necessary.

//--------
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(count + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [count]);

  return <div>{count}</div>;
}

// In this example, the 'useEffect' hook sets up an interval that increments the 'count' state variable every second. The cleanup function returned by the 'useEffect' hook cancels this interval by calling 'clearInterval' when the component unmounts or re-renders. This ensures that the interval is not still running in the background after the component is no longer being used.

// Example :
function App() {
    const [timer, setTimer] = useState(100)
    const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false)
    const [resetTime, setResetTime] = useState(900)

TypeError: destroy is not a function</span>
                  Quick solution:
Your useEffect call is probably implicit but it should be explicit.
<span style="color:#d55555;">
<b>Implicit</b>: useEffect(() => functionCall()); 
<b>Explicit</b>: useEffect(() => {
  return functionCall();
});
</span>
That should fix the error but I suggest you read further to understand why you have this error.

This error is a bit puzzling but makes a lot of sense when you get the hang of the <b>useEffect</b> hook.

Uncaught TypeError: destroy is not a function
It turns out this almost always happens when you try to return anything from your useEffect hook that is not a function. For example, you might be doing something like this:

<span style="color:#d55555;">useEffect(() => functionCall());</span>
Which is the same as doing something like this:
<span style="color:#d55555;">
useEffect(() => {
  return functionCall();
});
</span>
<b>Why This Won't Work?</b>
If you return anything from a <b>useEffect</b> function, it <b>must</b> be a function.

<u>Understanding The useEffect Hook and its Cleanup Function</u>
<i>If you return anything from the <u>useEffect</u> hook function, it must be a cleanup function</i>. This function will run when the component unmounts. This can be thought of as roughly equivalent to the <u>componentWillUnmount</u> lifecycle method in class components.

The following is an example of a <u>useEffect</u> that returns something it's allowed to return (a function). Furthermore, if we were to test this in action, we'd find that the text <u>"This will be logged on unmount"</u> indeed gets logged when our component unmounts.
<span style="color:#d55555;">
const myFunction = async () => {
    // run asynchronous tasks here
};
useEffect(() => myFunction());
</span>

Finally, the shorthand arrow function syntax allows developers to omit the curly braces around the function body, which is useful for simple one-liners. The value of the function body automatically becomes the return value of the arrow function, removing the need of the 'return' keyword. This functionality is called Implicit Return.

Now, how do these tidbits come together to cause such a cryptic error? Simply put, the value of myFunction, which is a Promise, becomes the return value of the arrow function in the useEffect hook. Remember that the useEffect hook expects a cleanup function to be returned? A Promise is not a function. so React stumbles and produces the error.

          <b>1) async/await useEffect</b>
<span style="color:#d55555;">
          is it good practice to add async to useEffect like this     useEffect(async () => {
        const { data } = await axios.get(
            'https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10'
          );
    },[]) </span>

No, it's generally <b>not a good practice</b> to make the <u>useEffect</u> callback itself <u>async</u>. This is because the <u>useEffect</u> hook expects the callback to return either <u>void</u> (nothing) or a cleanup function, but <u>async</u> functions return a <u>Promise</u>, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Here’s why you should avoid doing this:
<b>Problem:</b>
When you use an <u>async</u> function directly inside <u>useEffect</u>, it implicitly returns a <u>Promise</u>. However, React doesn't know how to handle that <u>Promise</u>, which can lead to issues with state updates and component lifecycle management.

<span style="color:#d55555;">
useEffect(async () => {
  const { data } = await axios.get('https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10');
}, []);</span>
This causes React to expect a return value from <u>useEffect</u>, but the <u>async</u> function returns a <u>Promise</u> instead of <u>undefined</u> or a cleanup function, which is the expected behavior.



          In this post you'll learn how to use an <b>async</b> function inside your React <b>useEffect</b> hook.
Perhaps you've been using the good old <b>Promise</b> syntax with a <b>.then()</b> method chain.

Let's take a Promise-based refactor things out and investigate how to use <b>async/await</b> functions with React's <b>useEffect</b> hook, as we could easily slip up and cause ourselves some headache without knowing a few key points.

Below, we're setting some initial state as <b>[]</b> via a <b>useState</b> hook, which of course we'll want to populate via a <b>GET</b> request when the component mounts.

After the component mounts, we let a <b>useEffect</b> hook spin off a quick <b>fetchUsers()</b> call which returns us a <b>Promise</b> type, which we evaluate via <b>.then()</b> and grab the data inside and use the <b>setUsers()</b> setter function to populate our users value.


This WORKS, but you should avoid it. Why? Because React's <b>useEffect</b> hook expects a cleanup function returned from it which is called when the component unmounts. Using an <b>async</b> function here will cause a bug as the cleanup function will never get called. Yikes! So what do we do?

Simply put, we should use an <b>async</b> function inside the <b>useEffect</b> hook. There are two patterns you could use, an immediately-invoked function expression (my preferred approach), or a named function that you invoke. Let's compare, and you can decide what you prefer.
`,
          code1: `// ❌ Don't do this!
useEffect(async () => {
  const users = await fetchUsers();
  setUsers(users);

  return () => {
    // this never gets called, hello memory leaks...
  };
}, []);


//--------------------

// *** immediately-invoked function expression ***
// 🆗 Ship it
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    setUsers(users);
  })();

  return () => {
    // this now gets called when the component unmounts
  };
}, []);

//  **** A named function that you invoke ****
// 🆗 Ship it
useEffect(() => {
  const getUsers = async () => {
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    setUsers(users);
  };

  getUsers(); // run it, run it

  return () => {
    // this now gets called when the component unmounts
  };
}, []);
`,
        },

          text1: `<b>2. Don't set state directly inside useEffect without proper checks</b>
Setting state inside <u>useEffect</u> is common, but you need to be careful when doing so. If you set state asynchronously and the component unmounts before the state is updated, it could lead to a memory leak or an error (e.g., <u>Cannot update a component while rendering a different component</u>).`,

// Correct: Use the cleanup function or check if the component is still mounted.
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;  // Flag to check if component is mounted

If you omit dependencies in the dependency array, you might run into bugs where <u>useEffect</u> doesn't behave as expected. If you put an empty array <u>[]</u>, it will only run once on mount, but if you need it to run again when certain values change, make sure to list those dependencies.

<b>Note</b>: Be cautious about nested functions inside useEffect. If you define a function inside the effect that references state or props, you must include those dependencies in the dependency array to avoid stale closures.

          text1: `<b>Canceling a fetch request</b>
                    By using a <b>useEffect cleanup</b> function, you can cancel the ongoing API request when the component is unmounted, like so:
                    
                    <b>AbortError</b> error Handling:

                    The <u>AbortError: signal is aborted without reason</u> typically occurs in JavaScript when using the Fetch API or other asynchronous operations that support aborting via an AbortController. This error indicates that an operation (like a fetch request) was aborted, but the reason for the abort was not specified or is not explicitly clear.

<b>Understanding the Error</b>
    <b>AbortController</b>: The <u>AbortController</u> API allows you to abort ongoing fetch requests or other asynchronous operations. You create an <u>AbortController</u> instance, pass its <u>signal</u> to the fetch request, and then call <u>abort()</u> on the controller when you want to cancel the request.
    <b>AbortError</b>: When an operation is aborted, the JavaScript runtime throws an <u>AbortError</u>. This is a standard error used to indicate that the operation was canceled.

<b>Common Causes</b>
    <b>Manual Abort Without Reason</b>: If you manually call <u>abort()</u> on an <u>AbortController</u> instance without providing a reason or message, you might see this error. While <u>AbortError</u> itself doesn't require a reason, it's helpful for debugging to understand why the abort occurred.
    <b>Fetch Requests Aborted</b>: If a fetch request is aborted (e.g., due to a component unmounting), the error may occur. This is especially common in React applications when using <u>useEffect</u> to manage data fetching and cleanup.

    <b>Key Points</b>
    <b>Handling AbortError</b>: When catching errors, check if the error is an <u>AbortError</u> to handle it specifically and distinguish it from other types of errors.
    <b>Clean-Up</b>: Always ensure you abort ongoing requests in the cleanup function of <u>useEffect</u> or similar lifecycle methods to avoid memory leaks and unwanted operations.
    <b>Debugging</b>: If you encounter this error frequently, ensure that abort operations are done intentionally and investigate why the abort might be happening unexpectedly.

    <b>🔥 Even stronger version (senior-level answer)
“AbortController is used to handle race conditions in fast-changing inputs like search. When a user types quickly, multiple API requests are fired. Since network responses are asynchronous, older requests may resolve after newer ones and cause incorrect UI updates. By aborting previous requests, we ensure only the latest request is active, improving both performance and UI correctness.”</b>

<b>🧠 What is a Race Condition?</b>
A race condition happens when multiple asynchronous operations run at the same time, and the final result depends on which one finishes first (not which one was started last).

🧠 Real example (very useful in interviews)
You can explain like this:
“For example, if a user types 'a → ap → app', without AbortController, responses may arrive out of order. The response for 'a' might overwrite 'app'. AbortController prevents this by canceling previous requests.”

<b>⚡ One-line memory version</b>
“AbortController prevents race conditions by cancelling outdated API requests in real-time user interactions like search.”

⚡ What AbortController actually does
It:
❌ cancels in-flight requests
❌ prevents outdated responses from updating UI
❌ avoids unnecessary processing of old results

                    -> It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

                    <b>useRef()</b> only returns one item. It returns an Object called <b>current</b>.
                    When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: <b>useRef(0)</b>.
                    It's like doing this: <b>const count = {current: 0}</b>. We can access the count by using <u>count.current</u>.

                    The useRef hook is one of the built-in hooks in React. You can use it to persist or preserve values between re-renders. The useRef hook takes an initial value of any type as argument and returns an object with a single current property.

                    useRef is one of the standard hooks provided by React. It will return an object that you can use during the whole lifecycle of the component.
                    The main use case for the useRef hook is to access a DOM child directly. I'll show exactly how to do that in another section.

                    Although accessing the DOM is the main use case, it doesn't mean it's the only one! useRef can also be very useful to hold a mutable value across different renders of your component.

                    The useRef Hook is a function that returns a mutable ref object whose <b>.current</b> property is initialized with the passed argument (<b>initialValue</b>). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

                    There are two main uses of useRef that are explained in the following sections:
                    - > Accessing the DOM nodes or React elements
                    - > keeping a mutable variable.
                    <b>useRef() hook creates references.</b>
                    Calling <b>const reference = useRef(initialValue)</b> with the initial value returns a special object named reference. The reference object has a property current: you can use this property to read the reference value reference.current, or update reference.current = newValue.

                    - > Between the component re-renderings, the value of the reference is persistent.
                    - > Updating a reference, contrary to updating state, doesn't trigger component re-rendering.
                    - > References can also access DOM elements. Assign the reference to ref attribute of the element you'd like to access: <b> &lt;div ref={reference}&gt;Element&lt;/div&gt;</b> - and the element is available at reference.current.
                    
                    <b>useRef</b> is like you said different from normal state variables managed with <b>useState</b> in React. While <b>useState</b> is designed to store state that causes re-renders when updated, <b>useRef</b> is designed to store mutable values that persist across renders without causing a re-render.


                    React will set the <b>initialValue</b> you pass to the <b>useRef</b> hook as the value of the <b>current</b> property of the returned <b>ref</b> object. As an example, if the <b>initialValue</b> is the boolean value <b>true</b>, then the <b>ref</b> object returned by the <b>useRef</b> hook will be <b>{ current: true }</b>. If you don't pass an initial value, the <b>current</b> property will be <b>undefined</b>.

The returned <b>ref</b> object is mutable. You can update and reference its value directly as in the example below. However, unlike react state, mutating the <b>ref</b> object doesn't re-render the Component.
                    `,

The ref object is a plain JavaScript object. Therefore, you can change its value from <b>null</b> to any data type. Similar to the <b>useRef</b> hook, changing its value doesn't re-render a React component.

Unlike the <b>useRef</b> hook, the <b>createRef</b> function always returns a new object. It's worth emphasizing that the <b>createRef</b> function is considered a legacy API.

One of the use cases of refs in React is to access DOM elements. React is declarative by design. However, sometimes you may need to access a DOM element imperatively.

You can use refs to access a rendered DOM element in your React Component instead of using methods such as <b>document.getElementById</b> or <b>document.querySelector</b>.

To access a DOM element, you can use the <b>ref</b> attribute of the element's corresponding JSX as in the example below. The value of theref attribute should be the <b>ref</b> object returned by the <b>useRef</b> hook in React functional components.`,

          text1: `<b>Differences between the useRef hook and the createRef function</b>
As discussed in the previous sections, you can create refs using either the <b>useRef</b> hook or the createRef function. However, there are differences between the two.

The <b>useRef</b> hook is for creating refs in React functional components. On the other hand, the <b>createRef</b> function is for creating refs in ES6 classes. The <b>createRef</b> function is considered a legacy API. Only use it if you're maintaining legacy codebase that uses class components.

The <b>useRef</b> hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns a ref object. React will set the ref object's <b>current</b> property to the initial value. If you don't pass an initial value, the value of the <b>current</b> property will initially be <b>undefined</b>. On the other hand, the <b>createRef</b> function doesn't take an argument. The ref object's <b>current</b> property will initially be set to <b>null</b>.

The </b>useRef</b> hook will always return the same ref object when a functional component re-renders. On the other hand, the </b>createRef</b> function returns a different object on every render.

<b>Best practices when working with refs</b>
As hinted above, the useRef hook comes in handy for persisting values of any type between re-renders. Be sure to follow the best practices below while using it.

=> Avoid over-reliance on refs. You should use refs as an escape hatch to access DOM elements, browser APIs, and work with systems external to your React application. If you find yourself over-relying on refs, probably there is something you're doing wrong.
=> Do not access or mutate refs during render. Accessing a ref during render leads to unpredictable results.

In addition to the best practices highlighted above, the <b>useRef</b> hook is like any other React hook. You must follow all the rules of hooks while using it.

These rules include invoking <b>useRef</b> at the top level in React functional components. You shouldn't use hooks inside conditional statements, loops, and event handlers. However, you can mutate the ref object inside conditional statements, loops, and event handlers.

          text1: `<b>When to use React useRef hook?</b>
1) <u>Accessing DOM Elements</u>: useRef is often used to directly access a DOM element in your JSX. This is useful for things like focusing on an input field upon a component mounting.

2) <u>Storing Mutable Data</u>: It allows you to store data that persists across renders but doesn't cause a re-render when updated, unlike useState.

3) <u>Referencing Interval or Timeout IDs</u>: Useful for keeping track of <u>setInterval</u> or <u>setTimeout</u> IDs, so you can clear them (like with <u>clearInterval or clearTimeout</u>) when needed.

4) <u>Tracking Previous State or Props</u>: It helps in keeping track of a component's previous state or props to compare with current values.

5) <u>Implementing Custom Hooks</u>: useRef can be used within custom hooks to retain stateful values or references across renders without triggering re-renders.

<b>Use-cases of refs in React</b>
The following are some ref use-cases in React:
=> <u>Interacting with input elements</u>: You can use refs to access input elements and implement functionalities like focus and auto-completion.
=> <u>Interacting with third-party UI libraries</u>: You can use refs to interact with third-party UI libraries that might be difficult to access using standard DOM methods. For instance, if you use a third-party library to generate sliders, you can use ref to reference the sliders' DOM element without accessing the library's source code.
=> <u>Media playback</u>: You may also access media assets like images, audio, and videos using refs. For instance, auto-playing videos and lazy loading images when an element enters the viewport.
=> <u>Complex animation triggering</u>: Traditionally, CSS keyframes or timeouts are used to determine when to initiate animations. You can also use refs to observe DOM elements and determine when to start an animation.

<b>You shouldn't use refs in the following cases</b>:
=> <u>Declarative cases</u>: As highlighted above, React is declarative by design. Do not use refs if you can write declarative code.
=> <u>Elements affecting state</u>: Mutating a ref doesn't re-render a component. Therefore, don't use refs when state changes need to trigger a re-render.
=> <u>Accessing functional components</u>: You can reference DOM elements and class components using refs because they have instances. On the other hand, functional components do not have instances. Therefore, the code below will not work.


<b>Ref Form Ex : 5</b>
use a <b>single useRef object</b> to hold multiple input refs like { fullname, area }, 

The <b>double arrow function</b> in this line:
React expects the ref prop to be either:
   1) A <b>ref object</b> (e.g., useRef()), or
   2) A callback function of the form <b>(element) => { ... }</b>
const setRef = (field) => (el) => {
  userDetailsRef.current[field] = el;
};


In your case, you want to assign multiple refs (e.g., fullname, area, etc.) dynamically using just one shared logic.

ref={setRef('fullname')}
will call setRef('fullname'), which returns a function:
(el) => {
  userDetailsRef.current['fullname'] = el;
}
That returned function becomes the callback ref, which React calls with the actual DOM element (el).

here's the expanded version without the double arrow:
function setRef(field) {
  return function (el) {
    userDetailsRef.current[field] = el;

This is particularly useful when you need to access a DOM element or component instance directly in a parent component but the desired child element is wrapped by a higher-order component or a component that doesn't expose the <b>ref</b> by default.

<b>forwardRef</b> takes a functional component as its argument and returns a new component with a forwarded <b>ref</b> attribute. This allows you to directly access the underlying child DOM node or instance from a parent component using the <b>ref</b>.

<b>React.forwardRef</b> is a higher-order component in React that allows you to forward a ref to a child component. This is particularly useful when you need to access the DOM nodes or component instances of a child component from a parent component.

<b>When to Use React.forwardRef</b>:
    <b>Accessing DOM Elements</b>: When you want to give a parent component access to a child component's DOM node.
    <b>Component Libraries</b>: When building reusable component libraries where the parent might need to interact directly with a component's DOM.
    <b>Higher-Order Components</b>: When wrapping components in higher-order components and you need to forward refs through them.

<b>Basic Usage of React.forwardRef</b>
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use <b>React.forwardRef</b>:
    <b>1) Create a Component Using forwardRef</b>: Define a component that accepts ref as a second argument in addition to its props. This ref will be forwarded to the underlying DOM element or component.

    <b>Function Signature: React.forwardRef</b> takes a render function that receives <b>props</b> and <b>ref</b>. The ref should be passed down to a DOM element or another component that you want to expose.
    <b>Handling Refs</b>: If the ref is forwarded to another component, that component must be able to handle refs, typically by using React.
    forwardRef itself.
    <b>Ref Forwarding and Functional Components</b>: React.forwardRef is most commonly used with functional components, but you can also use it with 
    class components if necessary.
    <b>Default Props and Context</b>: React.forwardRef does not affect how you set default props or use context. It only changes how refs are forwarded.

<b>Practical Use Cases</b>:
    <u>Integrating with Third-Party Libraries</u>: Forward refs to integrate with third-party libraries that require direct DOM manipulation.
    <u>Custom Input Components</u>: Build custom input components that need to expose their internal DOM elements (e.g., focus, selection).
    
    <b>Note</b>: In React 19+, <b>ref</b> is now a regular prop, so <b>forwardRef</b> is no longer needed — you can just accept <b>ref</b> directly in your component props.

    Before React 19, passing ref as a prop didn't work because of how React treated ref specially — it was reserved and intercepted by React itself before props ever reached your component.
<b>What happened internally</b>
&lt;MyComponent ref={myRef} name=&quot;John&quot; /&gt;

React processed this JSX and stripped <b>ref</b> out of the props object. So inside <b>MyComponent, props</b> would only contain <b>{ name: "John" } — ref</b> was simply never passed through.

<b>Why React did this</b>
React needed <b>ref</b> for its own internal reconciliation. When React renders a component, it uses the <b>ref</b> to attach to the DOM node or class instance after the render is committed. Since this was a framework-level concern, React claimed <b>ref</b> (along with <b>key</b>) as a reserved prop name.

<b>The consequence</b>
// This silently did NOTHING in React < 19
function MyInput(props) {
  console.log(props.ref); // undefined — ref is gone!
  return &lt;input ref={props.ref} /&gt;;
}
No error, no warning — <b>ref</b> just disappeared silently, which made it confusing to debug.

                    <b>What is Context in React?</b>
                    Instead of passing the props down through each component, React Context allows you to broadcast data to the components below.
                Accesses the value of a React context within a functional component.
                
                The <b>useContext</b> hook is used to consume values from a React context. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. 

                 <b>context</b> refers to a mechanism that allows data to be shared across multiple components without explicitly passing it through props. 

                 <b>Why useContext is Important</b>
<u>Sharing Data Across Components</u>
One of the main benefits of using context is the ability to share data across multiple components. This is especially useful when dealing with data that needs to be accessed by several components at different levels of the component tree.

<u>Avoiding Prop Drilling</u>
Prop drilling is the process of passing data from one component to another through props. This can become cumbersome and difficult to manage when data needs to be passed through multiple levels of components. Context eliminates the need for prop drilling by providing a centralized way to share data.

<b>1. Creating a Context in React</b>
To create a context in React, we use the <b>React.createContext</b> method. This method returns a context object that can be used to <u>provide and consume</u> values within the component tree.
<b>createContext</b> is a function provided by React to create a context. A context allows you to share values (such as state, functions, etc.) across the component tree without passing props explicitly at each level.
When you call <b>createContext()</b>, it returns a context object that contains two important components:

-> Provider
-> Consumer (usually replaced with useContext hook)
<span style="color:#aa1099">
This is done using <b>React.createContext()</b>. It returns a Context object.
import React, { createContext } from 'react';
export const AuthContext = createContext(); // Create the context </span>

<b>2. Provide a Context Value</b>: The <b>Context.Provider</b> component allows you to define the context value that child components can consume.
<span style="color:#aa1099">     &lt;AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/AuthContext.Provider&gt; 
    </span>
<b>3. Using the useContext Hook (Consume the Context)</b>: This can be done using the <b>Context.Consumer</b> component or the <b>useContext</b> hook in functional components.
<u>Accessing Context Values</u>
The <u>useContext</u> hook allows us to access the value of a context within a functional component. By passing the context object to the useContext hook, we can retrieve the current value of the context.
<u>Updating Context Values</u>
To update the value of a context, we use the context provider. The provider allows us to define the value that should be made available to all components that consume the context. 

-> When consumed by the <b>useContext</b> hook, it establishes a store for the required values. This enables the centralized management of these values within our application.
-> The <b>Provider</b> property of <b>AuthContext</b> allows any component to access the store. This is crucial for enabling components to retrieve or update stored values. The specific values that are made available to the components are determined by the <b>value</b> property of the <b>Provider</b> component.
<span style="color:#aa1099"> 
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { AuthContext } from 'AuthContext';
const { userData, loginAction } = useContext(AuthContext);
OR
const AuthContext = React.createContext();
export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
--- using useAuth custom hook ----
import { useAuth } from '../AuthContext'; 
  const { user, logout } = useAuth();
</span>
<b>=> Parameters </b>
<b>SomeContext</b>: The context that you've previously created with <b>createContext</b>. The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.
<b>=> Returns </b>
<b>useContext</b> returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest <b>SomeContext.Provider</b> above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the <b>defaultValue</b> you have passed to <b>createContext</b> for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

<b>=> warning </b>
<b>useContext()</b> call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the same component. The corresponding <b> <Context.Provider>  </b>needs to be above the component doing the <b>useContext()</b> call.
React automatically re-renders all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different <b>value</b>. The previous and the next values are compared with the <b>Object.is</b> comparison. Skipping re-renders with <b>memo</b> does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.
If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if <b>SomeContext</b> that you use to provide context and <b>SomeContext</b> that you use to read it are exactly the same object, as determined by a <b>===</b> comparison.

                    <b>Adding a Theme Provider</b>
Then we'll add a ThemeProvider component that will provide the context value to the child components.

<b>Implementing a Theme Switcher Child Component</b>
Next, we'll create a theme switcher component that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes with a button press. This component will consume the ThemeContext through useContext.

<b>Wrapping with the ThemeProvider</b>
In all React applications we have a functional component named <b>App</b> that serves as the root component of the React application. The <b>App</b> component is responsible for rendering the <b>ThemeSwitcher</b> component, which is a child component that allows users to switch between different themes (e.g., light and dark themes).

The <b>ThemeProvider</b> component is a context provider that is used to make the theme-related data and functionality available to all of its child components. The <b>ThemeProvider</b> component is created using the React context API and is responsible for managing the theme state and providing a function to toggle the theme.

The <b>ThemeSwitcher</b> component is wrapped inside the <b>ThemeProvider</b> component, which means that the <b>ThemeSwitcher</b> component (and any other child components inside the <b>ThemeProvider</b>) will have access to the theme context.

          text1: `<b>Context API</b> → For simple/global state sharing
          ✅ <b>Context API</b>
Built into React
Avoids prop drilling
Best for low-frequency updates

👉 Example:
Theme (dark/light)
Logged-in user info
Language (i18n)

<b>Redux</b> → For complex, scalable state management
<b>Redux</b>
External library
Centralized global store
Predictable state management using actions & reducers

👉 Example:
E-commerce cart
Complex dashboards
Multiple APIs + shared state

Context API is good for simple global state, but Redux is better for managing complex, frequently changing state with better performance and scalability.


🥇 <b>1. Scalability Answer (MOST IMPORTANT)</b>
<b>Context API</b> : In a large app, putting everything in one Context provider creates a "God Object" that is hard to maintain. Creating 20 different Context providers leads to a "Provider Wrapper Hell" in your App.js.
Context API is suitable for small and simple state, but it becomes hard to manage and scale when the app grows.
<b>The Redux Edge</b> : Redux allows you to split logic into slices. This keeps the code for "Loan Processing" entirely separate from "User Profile," even though they live in the same central store.
Redux provides a centralized store and predictable state management, which made our application more scalable and maintainable.

🥈 <b>2. Performance Answer (VERY STRONG)</b>
👉 Answer:
<b>Context API:</b> Context API triggers re-render for all consuming components whenever the value changes.
In our application, state updates were frequent, so this would have caused performance issues.
When a Context value changes, every component using useContext(MyContext) re-renders, even if it only uses a tiny piece of the data that didn't change.

<b>Redux</b>: optimizes re-renders by updating only the components that actually depend on the changed state, which improves performance.
Uses a <b>"Selector" pattern</b> (via useSelector). Redux performs a shallow comparison; if the specific piece of data you extracted hasn't changed, the component <b>will not re-render</b>.

🥉 <b>3. Debugging & DevTools Answer</b>
👉 Answer:
<b>Context API</b>: State changes are "silent." You have to manually add console.log inside your functions to see what happened.
<b>Redux</b>: Every single change is dispatched as a formal Action. The Redux DevTools act like a "Black Box" flight recorder for your app. You can literally see the exact millisecond a transaction failed and what the state looked like right before it happened.

🏅 <b>4. Complex Logic & Middleware Answer</b>
👉 Answer:
<b>Redux</b>: Our project involved multiple API calls, async operations, and complex business logic.
Redux supports middleware like thunk or saga, which helps handle async operations cleanly.
<b>Redux Middleware (Thunk/Saga)</b>: These allow you to intercept actions. For example, when a user clicks "Submit Loan," a middleware can:
    Trigger a loading spinner.
    Validate the local state.
    Make an API call.
    Log the result to an analytics service.
    Handle errors globally.
<b>Context API</b>: Context API does not provide a structured way to manage such complex logic.
Requires you to write this logic inside your components or custom hooks, which quickly becomes messy and repetitive.

🎖️ <b>5. Real-Time Project Justification (Financial Domain Based)</b>
Yes, I worked in a financial domain application where we handled customer data, loan details, and transaction-related information.

The application had multiple modules like customer onboarding, case management, and payment tracking, where the same data was shared across different components and pages.

The state was frequently updated and required consistency across the application.

In such cases, Context API was not suitable because it can cause unnecessary re-renders and becomes difficult to manage as the application grows.

We used Redux because it provides a centralized store, predictable state updates, and better debugging support.

This was especially important in financial applications where data accuracy and traceability are critical.

      title: "useReducer",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `<b>useReducer</b> is a React Hook that lets you add a reducer to your component.
                    
                    Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called a reducer.
    <span style="color:red">const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)</span>

Although reducers can <b>reduce</b> the amount of code inside your component, they are actually named after the <a href="javascript-notes.html#reduce() - reduce elements of an array to a value." target="_blank">reduce()</a> operation that you can perform on arrays.

The <b>reduce()</b> operation lets you take an array and <b>accumulate</b> a single value out of many:
<span style="color:red">
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = arr.reduce(
  (result, number) => result + number
); // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
</span>
The function you pass to reduce is known as a <b>reducer</b>. It takes the result so far and the current item, then it returns the <u>next result</u>. React reducers are an example of the same idea: they take the state so far and the action, and return the next state. In this way, they accumulate actions over time into state.

You could even use the <b>reduce()</b> method with an <b>initialState</b> and an array of <b>actions</b> to calculate the final state by passing your reducer function to it:

<span style="color:red"> useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?) </span>
Call useReducer at the top level of your component to manage its state with a reducer.

<b>What is a Reducer?</b>
A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. The reducer function is responsible for updating the state based on the action received. It's a core concept in the Redux library and also used with useReducer in React.

    <b>How Reducers Work</b>
    <b>Current State</b>: The current state of the application or a component.
    <b>Action</b>: An object that describes what happened and often contains additional data (payload).
    <b>New State</b>: The state after the action has been processed by the reducer.

<b>Parameters </b>
<u>reducer</u>: The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.
<u>initialArg</u>: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next init argument.
<u>optional init</u>: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it's not specified, the initial state is set to initialArg. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling init(initialArg).

<b>Returns </b>
useReducer returns an array with exactly two values:
1) The current state. During the first render, it's set to init(initialArg) or initialArg (if there's no init).
2) The dispatch function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

<b>Caveats </b>
=> <b>useReducer</b> is a Hook, so you can only call it <b>at the top level of your component</b> or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
=> In Strict Mode, React will <b>call your reducer and initializer twice</b> in order to <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer#my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice" target="_blank"> help you find accidental impurities</a>. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.

The <b>dispatch</b> function returned by <b>useReducer</b> lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the <b>dispatch</b> function:
<span style="color:red"> const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  // ... </span>
React will set the next state to the result of calling the <b>reducer</b> function you've provided with the current <b>state</b> and the action you've passed to <b>dispatch</b>.

<b>Parameters </b>
<b>action</b>: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a <b>type</b> property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.

<b>Returns </b>
<b>dispatch</b> functions do not have a return value.

<b>Caveats </b>
The <u>dispatch</u> function <b>only updates the state variable for the next render</b>. If you read the state variable after calling the <u>dispatch</u> function, <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer#ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value" target="_blank">you will still get the old value</a> that was on the screen before your call.

If the new value you provide is identical to the current <u>state</u>, as determined by an <u>Object.is</u> comparison, React will <b>skip re-rendering the component and its children</b>. This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn't affect your code.

React <a href="https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates" target="_blank">batches state updates</a>. It updates the screen <b>after all the event handlers have run</b> and have called their <b>set</b> functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/flushSync" target="_blank">flushSync</a>.


Then you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a <b>switch statement</b>. For each <b>case</b> in the <b>switch</b>, calculate and return some next state.

Actions can have any shape. By convention, it's common to pass objects with a <b>type</b> property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.

                    <b>useCallback</b> is a hook that will return a <b>memoized</b> version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
                    <b>Memoization</b> is a way to cache a result so that it doesn't need to be computed again. This can boost performance.
                    <span style="color:red"> useCallback(fn, dependencies) </span>
Call <b>useCallback</b> at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:

<b>useCallback</b>: A Hook that "memoizes" a function definition. It ensures the function's memory address remains the same between renders unless its dependencies change.

<b>What is useCallback?</b>
The useCallback hook is a performance optimization mechanism in React that helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components when their parent component re-renders. It achieves this by memoizing (caching) callback functions based on their dependencies. If the dependencies haven't changed, the same function reference is returned, avoiding the creation of a new function object on every render.

<b>Parameters</b> 
<b>fn</b> : The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the <b>dependencies</b> have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.
<b>dependencies</b> : The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the <b>fn</b> code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like <b>[dep1, dep2, dep3]</b>. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm.

<b>You need to pass two things to useCallback</b>:
1) A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.
2) A <b>list of dependencies</b> including every value within your component that's used inside your function.
On the initial render, the <b>returned function</b> you'll get from <b>useCallback</b> will be the function you passed.

<b>Returns</b> 
On the initial render, <b>useCallback</b> returns the <b>fn</b> function you have passed.
During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn  function from the last render (if the dependencies haven't changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.

<b>Caveats</b> 
=> <b>useCallback</b> is a Hook, so you can only call it <u>at the top level of your component</u> or your own Hooks. 
You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

On the following renders, React will compare the <b>dependencies</b> with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with <b>Object.is</b>), <b>useCallback</b> will return the same function as before. Otherwise, <b>useCallback</b> will return the function you passed on this render.
In other words, <b>useCallback</b> caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.

<b>When to Use useCallback</b>:
<b>Passing callbacks as props to child components</b>: When a parent component passes a callback function as a prop to a child component, and the child component relies on the same callback reference across renders (e.g., for event handlers), useCallback can prevent the child from re-rendering unnecessarily due to a change in the parent's state or props.
<b>Callbacks that are expensive to create</b>: If creating the callback function involves complex calculations or fetching data, using useCallback can improve performance by ensuring it's only created when its dependencies change.

<b>When Not to Use useCallback</b>:
<b>Simple callbacks without dependencies</b>: If a callback function is simple and doesn't have any dependencies that change frequently, using useCallback might not be necessary. The overhead of memoization could outweigh the potential performance benefit.
<b>Callbacks used within the same component</b>: If a callback is only used within the same component where it's created, there's no need for useCallback as React already handles component re-renders efficiently.


You are storing every version of <b>countHandler</b> in:<b>(Ex : 1 )</b>
const refCount = []
<b>1. The Dependency Logic</b>
The core of the experiment is this line:
[count < 2 ? 0 : count]

This creates a "dynamic" dependency. Let's look at how that dependency value changes across renders:
    Render 1 (count = 0): The dependency is 0.
    Render 2 (count = 1): The dependency is still 0 (because 1 < 2 is true).
    Render 3 (count = 2): The dependency becomes 2 (because 2 < 2 is false).

<b>2. The refCount Comparison</b>
By pushing the countHandler into a global array (refCount), you are keeping a record of the function's "identity" across renders. In JavaScript, two functions are only equal (===) if they are the exact same object in memory.

Initial	->(Count : 0)	 (Dependency Value : 0)   Function A (created)
1st Click	-> (Count : 1)	(Dependency Value : 0)	Function A (reused!)
2nd Click	-> (Count : 2)	(Dependency Value : 2)	Function B (created)

🥇 First Render (count = 0)
[count < 2 ? 0 : count] → [0]
👉 useCallback creates function → call it F1
refCount = [F1]

🥈 Click button → count = 1
Re-render happens
[count < 2 ? 0 : count] → [0]
👉 Dependency SAME as before ([0])
👉 So useCallback returns SAME function
F2 === F1 ✅
refCount = [F1, F1]

🥉 Click again → count = 2
Re-render again
[count < 2 ? 0 : count] → [2]
👉 Dependency changed (0 → 2)
👉 So useCallback creates NEW function → call it F3

refCount = [F1, F1, F3]
🔍 Your console checks
refCount[0] === refCount[1]  // true ✅
refCount[0] === refCount[2]  // false ❌

// <b>Let's walk through an example to see when this is useful.</b>
// Say you're passing a <b>handleSubmit</b> function down from the <b>ProductPage</b> to the <b>ShippingForm</b> component:

// You've noticed that toggling the <b>theme</b> prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <b> <ShippingForm /> </b>from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it's worth trying to optimize the <b> ShippingForm </b> component.

// <b>By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively</b>. This is why, when <b>ProductPage</b> re-renders with a different <b>theme</b>, the <b>ShippingForm</b> component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don't require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell <b>ShippingForm</b> to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in  <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/memo" target="_block"> memo </a>:

// <b>With this change, "ShippingForm" will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render.</b> This is when caching a function becomes important! Let's say you defined <b>handleSubmit</b> without <b>useCallback</b>:

        {
          text1: `<b>React.memo</b>: A Higher Order Component (HOC) that wraps a functional component. It prevents a re-render if the props haven't changed (using a shallow comparison).
<b>useCallback</b>: A Hook that "memoizes" a function definition. It ensures the function's memory address remains the same between renders unless its dependencies change.

<b>Why use them together?</b>
In JavaScript, functions are objects. Every time a parent component re-renders, any function defined inside it is <b>re-created.</b>
1) If you pass that function to a child wrapped in React.memo, the child sees a "new" prop.
2) React.memo does a shallow comparison, sees the new reference, and <b>re-renders anyway</b>.
3) <b>useCallback fixes</b> this by keeping the function reference stable.


🔥 <b>The Core Problem</b>
Every time a parent re-renders:
const handleClick = () => {
  console.log("clicked");
};
👉 This function is re-created (new reference) on every render.

🚨 What happens with React.memo?
const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click</button>;
});
👉 React.memo does shallow comparison of props.
So it checks:
prevProps.onClick === nextProps.onClick  // ❌ false (new function each time)
👉 Result: Child re-renders anyway
👉 ❌ Optimization failed


✅ <b>Solution</b>: useCallback
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("clicked");
}, []);
👉 Now React remembers the same function reference
prevProps.onClick === nextProps.onClick  // ✅ true
👉 Result: Child does NOT re-render unnecessarily

💡<b> Why use them together?</b>
Concept	Role
React.memo :	Prevents re-render if props are same
useCallback	: Keeps function reference stable

<b> interview </b>
We use useCallback with React.memo to prevent unnecessary child re-renders by maintaining a stable function reference, since React.memo does shallow comparison and would otherwise detect a new function on every render.

<b>2. Real-Time Example: The "Task List" (Ex :3 )</b>
Imagine an app where you have a list of tasks and a counter. Without optimization, incrementing the counter would cause every single task item to re-render, even if the task text didn't change.

<b>The Optimized Solution</b>
By wrapping the handler in useCallback, the TaskItem (wrapped in memo) can finally do its job.

const deleteTask = useCallback((id) => {
console.log("Deleted", id);
}, []); // Empty deps mean this reference NEVER changes
`,
          code1: `//-------------------   Ex : 1 ----------------------
// React.memo does shallow comparison → function reference changes → re-render happens

      &lt;label&gt;{label}: &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) =&gt; userHandler(e.target.value)}

export default function App() {
  const [user1, setUser1] = useState("");
  const [user2, setUser2] = useState("");
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  // ✅ Memoized handlers (IMPORTANT)
  const userHandler1 = useCallback((val) => {
    setUser1(val);
  }, []);

  const userHandler2 = useCallback((val) => {
    setUser2(val);
  }, []);

  // const userHandler1 = (val) => { setUser1(val) } 
  // const userHandler2 = (val) => { setUser2(val) }
  In this code, \`userHandler1\` and \`userHandler2\` are normal functions used to update \`user1\` and \`user2\` state. The issue is that whenever the \`App\` component re-renders, both functions are created again as new functions. So even though the logic is the same, \`userHandler1\` and \`userHandler2\` get new references every time. Because these functions are passed as props to \`UserInput\`, \`React.memo\` thinks the props have changed and re-renders the child components unnecessarily. This is why both inputs may re-render even when only one state is changing.

  // 🥇 Step 1: Initial Render
// React runs your component:
// const App = () => { ... }

// 👉 Creates:
// userHandler1 (Function A)
// userHandler2 (Function B)

// 👉 Passes to children:
// &lt;UserInput userHandler={userHandler1} /&gt;
// &lt;UserInput userHandler={userHandler2} /&gt;


// 🥈 Step 2: You type in user1 input
// setUser1(val)
// 👉 React updates state
// 👉 App component re-renders


// 🥉 Step 3: Re-render happens
// Now React runs App AGAIN:
// const App = () => { ... }

// 👉 NEW functions are created:
// userHandler1 → Function C ❗
// userHandler2 → Function D ❗

// 🚨 IMPORTANT POINT
// Even though logic is same:
// (val) => setUser1(val)

// 👉 But function reference is DIFFERENT:

          text1: `<b>How to Memoize a React Component</b>
                    In React, we implement memoization via <b>React.memo()</b>, which is a higher-order component. The React.memo serves as a wrapper for a component and returns a memoized output of that component, which prevents the component or sub-components from unnecessary re-rendering.

There are two ways by which we can use <b>React.memo</b> in our component. We can either use it to wrap the entire component or add it to the part where we export the component.
In the <b>example : 1 </b> below you will find the first way of using it:

In the syntax above, the <b>newComponent</b> component is wrapped with <b>React.memo()</b>, which creates a memoized version of the component. This memoized version of the component will only re-render if the props passed to it have changed.
And <b>example : 2 </b>  is the second way you can use <b>React.memo</b>:

The syntax above denotes that we can memoize a component by simply passing it as an argument to React.memo and exporting the result.
<b>Note</b>: React.memo has nothing to do with React hooks. It is an in-built method in React used to aid the optimization of our React applications. If you prefer using a hook to memoize your component, you can use memo in place of React.memo.

<b>Real Example:3 - Without vs With useCallback</b>
➡️ React reuses the same function reference until dependencies change.
➡️ When passed to a React.memo child, the child can truly skip re-rendering. ✅

📌 That’s why they often go together
<b>React.memo</b> prevents child re-renders if props are the same.
<b>useCallback</b> ensures function props actually stay the same.

    );
});
export default newComponent;

// ----------- Ex : 2 ----------
const newComponent = (props) => {
  //render with props
}
export default React.memo(newComponent);

          text1: `<b>useMemo</b> is one of the built-in hooks provided by React. It's used for memoization, which is an optimization technique to improve the performance of React components.

Memoization involves caching the results of complex logic so that they can be reused instead of being reimplemented on every render.
With useMemo, React can store the result of a function call and reuse it when the dependencies of that function haven't changed, rather than recalculating the value on every render.

<b>memoValue</b>: This is the variable that holds the memoized result of the function.
The first argument is a function that contains the code you want to memorize.
The second argument is an array of dependencies. If any of these dependencies change between renders, the memoized value will be changed.

But with <b>useMemo</b>, React remembers the result of that function as long as its inputs stay the same. So, if your inputs don't change, React just grabs the stored result instead of recalculating it every time. This saves time and makes your app snappier.

Call useImperativeHandle at the top level of your component to customize the ref handle it exposes:

<b>Parameters</b> 
<u>ref</u>: The ref you received as the second argument from the forwardRef render function.
<u>createHandle</u>: A function that takes no arguments and returns the ref handle you want to expose. That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.
<u>optional dependencies</u>: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the <u>createHandle</u> code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like <u>[dep1, dep2, dep3]</u>. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, your <u>createHandle</u> function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.

        <b>useLayoutEffect</b> runs synchronously after all DOM updates but before the browser has a chance to paint. This means that if you need to perform measurements or make changes that need to occur before the user sees the updated layout, you should use this hook.

    <u>Usage</u>:
        The API is the same as <b>useEffect</b>, taking a function as the first argument and a dependency array as the second.
        However, it's typically used for operations that require reading from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering before the browser paints.

    <u>Use Cases</u>:
        Measuring the size or position of elements after they are rendered.
        Applying styles or animations that need to be in place before the paint.
        Avoiding flickers or layout shifts by ensuring that updates are applied immediately.

        <b>What is the problem with useEffect?</b>
As stated above the <u>useEffect</u> hook is <u>asynchronous</u> this has a significant drawback in that it can only be called after the component has been mounted. This implies that side effects that depend on the layout of the component cannot be carried out using <u>useEffect</u>.

Unlike the <b>useEffect</b> hook, the <b>useLayoutEffect</b> hook runs <u>synchronously</u> which means it runs immediately after React has performed all the necessary DOM mutations but just before the browser paints the screen. It has the same API and possesses a similar syntax as the <b>useEffect</b> hook.

<b>Behavior</b>: It is non-blocking. The browser paints the update, and then the effect runs.

          <b>When it runs</b>: After React performs DOM mutations, but before the browser paints the screen.
<b>Behavior</b>: It is blocking. The browser will wait for this code to finish before it actually shows the user the updated UI.
<b>Use Case</b>: Use this when you need to measure the DOM (like getting the height of an element) and change the UI based on that measurement before the user sees it.

<b>Preventing "Visual Flickering"</b>
<b>The Scenario</b>: You have a tooltip that needs to be positioned exactly above a button.
    <b>With useEffect</b>: 1. React renders the tooltip at a default position (e.g., top: 0).
    2. The browser paints the tooltip at the top.
    3. useEffect fires, measures the button's position, and updates the tooltip state.
    4. React re-renders; the browser paints the tooltip in the correct spot.
    5. <b>Result</b>: The user sees the tooltip "jump" or "flicker" from the top to the button.

    <b>With useLayoutEffect:</b>
        React renders the tooltip.
        <b>useLayoutEffect</b> fires immediately. It measures the button and updates the tooltip position.

                    React that allows you to extract and reuse stateful logic from functional components. By creating custom hooks, you can encapsulate complex logic into reusable functions and share that logic across different components. Custom Hooks follow a naming convention: their names start with <b>use</b> (e.g., useCustomHook).

                    A Custom Hook is a function in Javascript whose name begins with <b>use</b> and which calls other hooks. It is a part of React v16.8 hook update and permits you for reusing the stateful logic without any need for component hierarchy restructuring.

                    In almost all of the cases, custom hooks are considered to be sufficient for replacing render props and HoCs (Higher-Order components) and reducing the amount of nesting required. Custom Hooks will allow you for avoiding multiple layers of abstraction or wrapper hell that might come along with Render Props and HoCs.

                    The disadvantage of Custom Hooks is it cannot be used inside of the classes.

This is commonly achieved using libraries like <b>React Router</b>. Here's a breakdown of how 
                    
                    To configure React router, navigate to the <b>index.js</b> file, which is the root file, and import <b>BrowserRouter</b> from the <b>react-router-dom</b> package that we installed, wrapping it around our App component as follows:

In the latest version of React Router (version 6 and beyond), routing has become even more intuitive and powerful. Here's a breakdown of the key features and concepts:

<b>Key Features of React Router v6</b>
    <b>Simplified Route Definitions</b>:
        The syntax for defining routes has been simplified. You no longer need the <u>Switch</u> component; instead, routes are wrapped in <u>Routes</u>.
    <b>Nested Routes</b>:
        Nesting routes is straightforward, allowing you to create layouts that can render child components based on the current route.
    <b>Automatic Route Matching</b>:
        React Router v6 uses a more intelligent route matching algorithm, allowing for better handling of route priorities and wildcard matching.
    <b>New Hooks</b>:
        Hooks like <u>useNavigate</u>, <u>useParams</u>, <u>useLocation</u>, and <u>useRoutes</u> simplify navigation and route management.
   <b>Element Rendering</b>:
        Instead of using the <u>component</u> prop, you now use the <u>element</u> prop to specify the component to render.
        
     <b>Router</b>: The entire application is wrapped in <b>BrowserRouter</b>, enabling routing. The router is the top-level component that provides the routing infrastructure. In React Router, you typically use BrowserRouter for web applications and HashRouter for static sites.
     <b>Link</b>: Used to create navigation links. Clicking a link changes the URL without reloading the page. The Link component enables navigation by creating anchor-like elements that maintain the application's state.
     <b>Routes</b>: A new component that replaces <b>Switch</b>. It renders the first matching <b>Route</b>. The reason for this is because it's Routes job is to understand all of its children Route elements, and intelligently choose which ones are the best to render.
     <b>Route</b>: The <b>element</b> prop is used to specify which component to render for a given path. The <b>path='*'</b> acts as a catch-all for unmatched routes, rendering the <b>NotFound</b> component. A route is a mapping between a URL and a component. When a user visits a specific URL, React Router renders the corresponding component.

          text1: `<b>BrowserRouter</b> is a component provided by the React Router library that enables client-side routing in React applications using the HTML5 history API. It allows your application to handle dynamic routing and navigation without full page reloads, creating a more seamless user experience.

                    <b>BrowserRouter</b>: BrowserRouter is top level component. BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API (pushstate, replacestate, and popstate events) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component used to store all other components.

                    <b>Key Features of BrowserRouter</b>
    <u>History API</u>:
        BrowserRouter uses the browser's history stack to manage navigation. This means it can push and pop entries from the history stack, allowing users to use the browser's back and forward buttons to navigate.
    <u>URL Management</u>:
        It updates the URL in the browser's address bar as users navigate through the application, enabling deep linking to specific routes.
    <u>Nested Routing</u>:
        You can nest routes within BrowserRouter, making it easier to structure your application's routing.
    <u>React Context</u>:
        It provides routing-related data to all components within its scope via React's Context API, enabling easy access to routing information.

        <b>basename</b>
Configure your application to run underneath a specific basename in the URL:

                    We can see in the above code that we imported <b>Routes</b> and <b>Route</b> components from <b>react-router-dom</b> and then used them to declare the routes we want. All Routes are wrapped in the Routes tag, and these Routes have two major properties:

<b>path</b>: As the name implies, this identifies the path we want users to take to reach the set component. When we set the <b>path</b> to <b>/about</b>, for example, when the user adds <b>/about</b> to the URL link, it navigates to that page.

<b>element</b>: This contains the component that we want the set path to load. This is simple to understand, but remember to import any components we are using here, or else an error will occur.
                    
The <b>NavLink</b> component from react-router-dom is a special component that helps you navigate different routes using the <b>to</b> prop. <b>The NavLink</b> component also knows whether the route is currently "active" and adds a default <b>active</b> class to the link. We can use this class in our CSS to define some styling for active links, as shown below:

<b>How to fix No Routes Found Error</b>
When routing, a situation may cause a user to access an unconfigured route or a route that does not exist; when this occurs, React does not display anything on the screen except a warning with the message <u>No routes matched location.</u>

                    Advanced Features
    <b>Nested Routes</b>: You can define nested routes directly in your component structure:
<b>Programmatic Navigation</b>: Use the useNavigate hook to programmatically navigate:
<b>Route Parameters</b>: You can access route parameters using the useParams hook:

          text1: `<b>Programmatically Navigate</b>
React Router offers two different ways to programmatically navigate, depending on your preference. First is the <b>imperative navigate</b> method and second is the <b>declarative Navigate</b> component.

To get access to the <b>imperative navigate</b> method, you'll need to use React Router's <b>useNavigate</b> Hook. From there, you can pass <b>navigate</b> the new path you'd like the user to be taken to when <b>navigate</b> is invoked.

It offers a more streamlined and minimal code footprint (no use of <b>useState</b> within the component) and an easy imperative style, but it fails to be as clear on the intent of the code without further investigation - making us look inside the callback function for the <b>onClick</b> handler to see what is expected to happen. It requires more thinking, whereas the declarative &lt;Navigate /&gt; does not.


Using a <b>declarative navigation</b> approach with React Router's &lt;Navigate /&gt; component allows us to specify exactly when a navigation event occurs within our JSX - making it clear when and where the navigation will happen.

It's also easier to read and understand because the navigation is part of the JSX structure, and not nested somewhere deep down within a callback function. Why might you want to do this? Conditional rendering.

Let's assume a settings component that displays the app settings, with a button to return to the home page - redirecting a user based on an event they initiated. Using the &lt;Navigate /&gt; component is a super use case here to create a clear divide in component logic and operations:

If you'd prefer a more <b>declarative</b> approach, you can use React Router's <b>Navigate</b> component.

<b>Navigate</b> works just like any other React component, however, instead of rendering some <b>UI</b>, it navigates the user to a new location.

The useHistory() hook is now deprecated. If you are using React Router 6, the proper way to navigate programmatically is as follows:

                  One of the key components provided by <b>react-router-dom</b> is createBrowserRouter
                  
                  createBrowserRouter is a function in React Router (introduced in version 6.4) that allows you to create a router instance for managing your application's routing using the HTML5 history API. This function is part of the new data routing features that simplify how you define and manage routes in a React application.

                  <b>Key Features</b>
    <b>Declarative Routing</b>: It allows you to define routes in a clear and declarative manner, using an array of route objects.
    <b>Nested Routes</b>: You can easily set up nested routes, making it simple to manage complex routing structures.
    <b>Loaders</b>: You can attach loaders to routes to fetch data before rendering the component, ensuring that the required data is available upfront.
    <b>Error Handling</b>: It supports error elements, allowing you to define how to handle errors that occur during data loading.
    <b>Integration with RouterProvider</b>: It works with RouterProvider to provide context to your components.

    <b>Nested Routes</b>
Nested routes are super handy for managing complex applications. They let you define routes within other routes, which is great for layouts where some components are always visible (like a navigation bar) while others change based on the route.

<b>Route Parameters</b>
Need to capture values from the URL? Route parameters have got you covered. This is especially useful for dynamic routing, like displaying user profiles or articles based on an ID.

<b>Error Handling</b>
You can define error handling routes to display custom error pages for specific conditions:

<b>Data Fetching</b>
React Router 6 introduces the ability to define loaders and actions for routes, which can handle data fetching and mutations. This ensures data is loaded before a component is rendered:

<b>Use Lazy Loading</b>
For better performance, use lazy loading to load components only when needed. React's lazy and Suspense can help with this:

createBroweserRouter gets an array with objects. Those objects are containing our route logic with some keys such as path, element, children.
Basically, path that we give is belong to the element which is a component in our app. That path shall render the related component. errorElement helps us to manage errors with its own component. The component in the errorElement can contain its own Link that helps us to go back to home page. We can also use children key for creating another routing logic in certain path we choose. path: “/prices/:crypto” allow us to dynamically give a selected path. With using react-query, axios and useState we can connect them to this :crypto so that When user select from a display its dynamically fetches the chosen one with its id and give it into :crypto. path: “/prices/SELECTED ITEM”

This is the recommended router for all React Router web projects. It uses the <u>DOM History API</u> to update the URL and manage the history stack.

It also enables the v6.4 data APIs like <u>loaders, actions, fetchers</u> and more.

Due to the decoupling of fetching and rendering in the design of the data APIs, you should create your router outside of the React tree with a statically defined set of routes. For more information on this design, please see the Remixing React Router blog post and the When to Fetch conference talk.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<b>createBrowserRouter</b> is a big step up from the traditional <b>Switch</b> component, offering enhanced flexibility and functionality. With features like nested routes, route parameters, error handling, and data fetching, you can create dynamic and efficient routes for your projects.

                  useLoaderData is a hook provided by React Router (starting from version 6.4) that allows components to access data loaded for a route. It is part of the new data loading APIs that simplify data fetching in your applications.

                  The <b>useLoaderData</b> hook in React Router 6 is a powerful tool that allows you to fetch data for your routes and make it available to your components before they are rendered. This can be useful for a number of reasons, such as improving performance, preventing empty states, and providing a better user experience.

<b>Why is useLoaderData useful?</b>
Here are some of the benefits of using the <u>useLoaderData</u> hook:

<u>Improved performance</u>: By fetching data for your routes before they are rendered, you can improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of network requests that are made.
<u>Prevented empty states</u>: By making data available to your components before they are rendered, you can prevent empty states from being displayed to your users.
<u>Better user experience</u>: By providing your users with data as soon as possible, you can improve the user experience of your application.

<b>How to use useLoaderData</b>
To use the <u>useLoaderData hook</u>, you first need to define a loader function. A loader function is a function that fetches data for a route.

Once you have defined a loader function, you can use the <u>useLoaderData</u> hook in your route components to access the data that was fetched by the loader function.

The <u>useLoaderData</u> hook will return the data that was fetched by the loader function for the current route. In this example, the <u>useLoaderData</u> hook will return an array of posts.

After route actions are called, the data will be revalidated automatically and return the latest result from your loader.

Note that <u>useLoaderData</u> does not initiate a fetch. It simply reads the result of a fetch React Router manages internally, so you don't need to worry about it refetching when it re-renders for reasons outside of routing.

This also means data returned is stable between renders, so you can safely pass it to dependency arrays in React hooks like <u>useEffect</u>. It only changes when the loader is called again after actions or certain navigations. In these cases the identity will change (even if the values don't).

You can use this hook in any component or any custom hook, not just the Route element. It will return the data from the nearest route on context.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The <u>useLoaderData</u> hook is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance, prevent empty states, and provide a better user experience for your React applications.

The first thing to be aware of is the presence of a handful of new Data APIs that only work on routes defined via the new data routers (i.e., createBrowserRouter). These include a few categories of APIs:

Route-level data APIs such as loader, action, shouldRevalidate, handle, and lazy
In-component data hooks such as useLoaderData, useActionData, useFetcher, useMatches, useNavigation, etc.
Error-handling APIs such as route.errorElement, route.ErrorBoundary, and useRouteError
The rest of the APIs that existed prior to v6.4.0 are still usable in both BrowserRouter and RouterProvider apps. These include common hooks/components such as useNavigate, useLocation, useParams, <Link>, <Outlet />, etc.`,

      note: [
        {
          text1: `The <b>useMemo</b> hook in React is used to memoize the result of a computation and prevent unnecessary recalculations. It is particularly useful in situations where a computation is expensive or time-consuming, and you want to avoid repeating it on every render. Here are some common situations where you might use useMemo:

                    <b>1. Computations in Functional Components</b>:
                    When performing heavy computations or complex operations within a functional component, <b>useMemo</b> can be used to memoize the result:

                    In this example, processedData will be memoized, and the expensive processData function will only be recomputed when the data dependency changes.

                    <b>2. Preventing Unnecessary Renderings</b>:
                    If a component depends on props or state, and the rendering is computationally expensive, you can use <b>useMemo</b> to memoize the JSX markup:

                    In this example, <b>renderedContent</b> is memoized, and the JSX markup will only be recomputed when prop1 or prop2 changes.

                    <b>3. Optimizing Expensive Function Calls</b>:
                    If your component uses a function from a third-party library that is computationally expensive and doesn't depend on props or state changes, you can use useMemo to memoize the function:

                    This ensures that the expensive function is only called once during the component's lifecycle.

                    <b>4. Memoizing Callback Functions</b>:
                    When passing functions as props to child components, useMemo can be used to memoize the callback functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components:

                    By memoizing the handleClick function, you ensure that the child component doesn't re-render unnecessarily when the parent re-renders.

                    Use <b>useMemo</b> when the performance benefits of memoization outweigh the cost of maintaining the memoized value. It's important to note that useMemo is not a silver bullet, and incorrect usage might lead to performance issues. Always measure and profile your application to ensure that memoization provides the expected performance improvements.`,

      title: "How would you avoid binding in React?",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `To avoid the need for binding we have something introduced in ES6 as arrow functions. Using the arrow function to call this.setState will lead to avoiding the use of bind. When we use the arrow function it works because of the following reasons:

                    ● It does not re-scope this, so we don't need to bind this in the class constructor.
                    ● JavaScript has first-class functions, which means functions are considered as data. Therefore, arrow functions can be assigned to class properties.

                    In React, binding can be avoided through various techniques, especially with the introduction of functional components and the use of arrow functions. Here are some methods to avoid binding in React:

                    <b>1. Arrow Functions in Class Components</b>:
                    Use arrow functions for class methods. Arrow functions automatically bind the lexical scope, eliminating the need for explicit binding in the constructor.

                    <b>2. Arrow Functions in Functional Components</b>:
                    For functional components, use arrow functions directly in the JSX or define them outside the component. This way, you don't need to bind the functions explicitly.

                    <b>3. Function Declarations Outside Render</b>:
                    Avoid defining functions within the render method to prevent them from being recreated on every render. This is particularly important for performance.

                    <b>4. Binding in the Constructor (Class Components)</b>:
                    If you still need to use class components and traditional function declarations, you can bind methods in the constructor. However, this approach is less concise compared to using arrow functions.

                    <b>5. Function Components with Hooks</b>:
                    In functional components using hooks, you don't need to worry about binding issues. Hooks preserve the lexical scope, making it easy to use functions without binding.

                    By adopting these practices, you can write more concise and readable code while avoiding common binding issues in React components. Arrow functions and functional components with hooks offer a more modern and cleaner approach to handling functions and their scope in React applications.`,

        {
          text1: `React does so by <b>mounting</b>" (adding nodes to the DOM), <b>unmounting</b>" (removing them from the DOM), and <b>updating</b>" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).

                    Mounting is the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (e.g. DOM or Native Components).

                    In React, a <b>mounted component</b>" refers to a component that has been rendered and attached to the DOM (Document Object Model). In the React component lifecycle, there are several phases a component goes through, and the term <b>mounted</b> specifically refers to the phase when the component has been successfully rendered to the DOM.

                    Here's a brief overview of the React component lifecycle and the <b>mounted</b> phase:

                    <b><span style="color:red">Mounting Phase</span></b>:
                    <b>constructor()</b>: The initial phase where the component is initialized, and state and props are set up.
                    <b>static getDerivedStateFromProps()</b>: A static method that is called before every render to update the state based on changes in props.
                    <b>render()</b>: The method that returns the JSX representation of the component.
                    <b>componentDidMount()</b>: Invoked after the component has been rendered to the DOM. This is the phase where side effects such as data fetching or subscriptions can be performed. The component is considered "mounted" at this point.

                    <b><span style="color:red">Updating Phase</span></b>:
                    <b>static getDerivedStateFromProps()</b>: Similar to the mounting phase, but occurs before each render during updates.
                    <b>shouldComponentUpdate()</b>: Determines if the component should re-render. If false is returned, the component won't re-render.
                    <b>render()</b>: Re-renders the component based on state or prop changes.
                    <b>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</b>: Captures information about the DOM before the update.
                    <b>componentDidUpdate()</b>: Invoked after the component has been updated in the DOM.

                    <b><span style="color:red">Unmounting Phase</span></b>:
                    <b>componentWillUnmount()</b>: Invoked just before the component is unmounted and removed from the DOM. Cleanup operations can be performed here.

                    <b><span style="color:red">Error Handling Phase</span></b>:
                    <b>static getDerivedStateFromError()</b>: Used to update state in response to a JavaScript error during rendering.
                    <b>componentDidCatch()</b>: Invoked after an error has been thrown in a descendant component.
                    The <b>mounted</b> phase is crucial for performing actions that should only occur once the component is visible in the DOM. For example, you might use componentDidMount to initiate data fetching, subscribe to events, set up timers, or perform other side effects.

                    In summary, a mounted component is a component that has completed its initial rendering and is now part of the DOM, allowing you to perform tasks specific to the component's presence in the user interface.`,
          code1: `// In a functional component with hooks, the equivalent to componentDidMount is the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array:

      title: "Explain what an event is in React.",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `● Events in React JS allow developers to respond to user interaction within their applications quickly and efficiently.
                    ● Events are triggered whenever certain actions occur - from clicks to key presses - which then fire off callback functions so that appropriate responses can be made accordingly.

                    In React, an event is an occurrence triggered by the user or the system that can be detected and handled by React components. Events in React are similar to events in standard HTML but are handled in a more declarative way using JSX syntax.

                    Basic Concepts:
                    Event Handling in JSX:
                    In React, events are attached using JSX syntax, similar to HTML. For example, handling a button click is done like this:

                    &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
                    Here, handleClick is a function that will be called when the button is clicked.

                    <b>SyntheticEvent</b>:
                    React uses SyntheticEvent, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event, to provide a consistent API for handling events. This abstraction allows React to optimize and normalize event handling.

                    <b>Event Handling in Class Components</b>:
                    In class components, event handlers are usually defined as methods within the component class. The methods are then attached to the corresponding events in the JSX.

                    <b>Event Handling in Functional Components with Hooks</b>:
                    In functional components, the useState and useEffect hooks are often used to manage state and side effects related to events.

                    Common Events in React:-
                    <b>onClick</b>: Triggered when a clickable element, like a button or a link, is clicked.
                    <b>onChange</b>: Triggered when the value of an input element changes (e.g., in a text input or a dropdown).
                    <b>onSubmit</b>: Triggered when a form is submitted.
                    <b>onMouseOver/onMouseOut</b>: Triggered when the mouse pointer enters/exits an element.
                    <b>Handling Events with Parameters</b>:
                    To pass parameters to an event handler, you can use an arrow function in the JSX:

                    &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; handleClick(param)}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
                    Alternatively, you can use the bind method:

                    &lt;button onClick={handleClick.bind(this, param)}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

                    In summary, events in React are interactions triggered by users or the system that can be handled by React components. Event handling is an essential aspect of building interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React applications.`,

      title: "Explain what MVC architecture is",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it is a software architectural pattern used for designing and organizing code in applications. The MVC architecture separates an application into three interconnected components, each with distinct responsibilities, to enhance modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The three components are as follows:

                    <b>Model (M)</b>:
                    The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing the application's state, processing data, and enforcing business rules.
                    The Model is independent of the user interface and is not concerned with how the data is presented or how the user interacts with it.

                    <b>View (V)</b>:
                    The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and receiving user input. It represents the user interface components, such as buttons, forms, and graphical elements.
                    The View is unaware of the underlying data and business logic. It relies on the Model to provide the necessary data and updates the user interface accordingly.

                    <b>Controller (C)</b>:
                    The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, and updates the Model accordingly.
                    The Controller is responsible for handling user interactions, making decisions based on user input, and updating both the Model and the View as needed.
                    In some variations of the MVC pattern, the Controller may be responsible for handling application-level logic and managing the flow of data between the Model and the View.
                    Key Principles of MVC:
                    Separation of Concerns:

                    The primary goal of MVC is to separate different aspects of an application to make the code more modular and maintainable.
                    The Model, View, and Controller have distinct responsibilities, and changes in one component should not directly affect the others.

                    <u>Reusability</u>:
                    The modular structure of MVC promotes the reuse of components. For example, a different View can be created to display the same data, or a different Controller can handle user input in a different way without affecting the underlying Model.
                    
                    <u>Testability</u>:
                    The separation of concerns makes it easier to test each component independently. Unit testing can be performed on the Model, View, and Controller to ensure their individual functionality.
                    
                    <u>Scalability</u>:
                    MVC architecture provides a scalable structure that facilitates the addition of new features or the modification of existing ones without major disruptions. Changes in one component are less likely to impact others.
                    Example in Web Development:
                    In the context of web development, MVC is often used to structure web applications:

                    <b>Model (M)</b>: Represents the data and business logic. It could involve data storage, retrieval, and processing.
                    <b>View (V)</b>: Represents the user interface and how the data is presented. It includes HTML, CSS, and UI components.
                    <b>Controller (C)</b>: Manages user input, updates the Model, and interacts with the View. It often involves server-side logic and routes requests.
                    For example, in a web application using a framework like Django (Python) or Ruby on Rails (Ruby), the framework often follows an MVC architecture. The Model handles database operations, the View handles rendering HTML and presenting data, and the Controller manages the flow of data between the Model and the View.

                    Overall, the MVC architecture provides a structured and organized approach to building applications, facilitating better code organization, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.`,

      title: "What are package managers in React.js?",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `In React.js, package managers are tools that facilitate the installation, management, and dependency resolution of JavaScript packages and libraries. They help developers streamline the process of managing project dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions of packages are installed and available for use in the application. Two popular package managers used in the React.js ecosystem are:

                    <b>npm (Node Package Manager)</b>:
                    npm is the default package manager for Node.js, and it is widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem, including React.js development.
                    npm allows developers to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages and libraries.
                    It is often used to install React itself, as well as third-party libraries and tools.
                    <u>Package.json</u>:
                    package.json is a file in the root of a Node.js project that lists dependencies and other metadata.
                    It includes information about the project, scripts, and dependencies, allowing developers to define and manage the project's dependencies.

                    <b>Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)</b>:
                    Yarn is another package manager for JavaScript that was developed by Facebook in collaboration with other companies.
                    It is compatible with npm and offers faster and more reliable dependency management.
                    Yarn uses a lockfile (yarn.lock) to ensure deterministic and reproducible installations.
                    <u>Yarn.lock</u>:
                    Similar to package.json, the yarn.lock file is generated by Yarn and locks down the versions of dependencies to ensure consistency across different environments.
                    Choosing between npm and Yarn often depends on personal preference and the requirements of the project. Both package managers are widely used in the React.js community, and developers can seamlessly switch between them without compatibility issues. It's essential to adhere to the chosen package manager's conventions and use the associated configuration files (package.json and yarn.lock) for managing project dependencies.`,

      title: "Explain what a pure function is.",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `A pure function is a function in programming that has two main characteristics:
                    <b>Deterministic</b>:
                    A pure function produces the same output for the same set of input parameters every time it is invoked. There are no hidden or external factors that can cause the function to behave differently for the same inputs.

                    <b>No Side Effects</b>:
                    A pure function does not cause any observable side effects outside of its scope. It means that when a pure function is called, it doesn't modify any external state, doesn't mutate input parameters, doesn't interact with I/O devices, and doesn't perform any other actions that could affect the program's state or the outside world.
                    In essence, a pure function is like a mathematical function. Given the same input, it will always produce the same output, and it won't change anything outside of its scope. Pure functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming and have several advantages:

                    <b>Advantages of Pure Functions</b>:
                    <u>Predictability</u>:
                    Since pure functions are deterministic, you can predict their behavior based on their inputs, making code easier to reason about.
                    <u>Testability</u>:
                    Pure functions are easy to test because you can isolate them from the rest of the program. You only need to consider the inputs and outputs without worrying about external state.
                    <u>Concurrency</u>:
                    Pure functions are inherently thread-safe and can be parallelized easily. They don't rely on shared state that might be modified concurrently by multiple threads.
                    <u>Cacheability</u>:
                    Because pure functions always produce the same output for the same inputs, the results can be cached, leading to potential performance optimizations.
                    <u>Debugging</u>:
                    Debugging is simplified because the behavior of pure functions is determined solely by their inputs and not by hidden or changing external factors.

                    In the above examples, add and square are pure functions because they meet the criteria of being deterministic and having no side effects. On the other hand, impureAdd is not a pure function because it modifies the external state (result), leading to observable side effects.

                    By adhering to the principles of pure functions, developers can write code that is more modular, easier to understand, and less error-prone, especially in functional programming paradigms.

      note: [
        {
          text1: `In React, a pure function refers to a specific type of function that satisfies the principles of functional programming, particularly the characteristics of pure functions. Pure functions in the context of React are often associated with functional components and are essential for building predictable and maintainable UIs.

                    Here are the key characteristics of a pure function in the context of React:

                    <b>Deterministic</b>:
                    A pure function in React is deterministic, meaning that given the same set of input props and state, it will always produce the same output (Virtual DOM representation) during each invocation.

                    <b>No Side Effects</b>:
                    A pure function should not cause any side effects. It should not modify the state outside of its scope, interact with external APIs, or perform any other actions that could affect the application's state or the outside world.

                    <b>Props and State as Input</b>:
                    A pure function in React typically takes the component's props and state as input parameters. It produces a Virtual DOM representation based on these inputs.

                    <b>No Mutation of Props or State</b>:
                    A pure function should not mutate the input props or state. Instead, it should treat them as immutable data and create new objects or values as needed.

                    Advantages of Pure Functions in React</b>:
                    <b>Predictable Rendering</b>:
                    Pure components render predictably based on their input props and state, making it easier to reason about their behavior.

                    <b>Improved Performance</b>:
                    React can optimize the rendering process for pure components more effectively, leading to potential performance improvements.

                    <b>Easier Testing</b>:
                    Pure components are easier to test since their behavior is solely determined by their inputs, and they don't rely on external state changes.

                    <b>Facilitates Memoization</b>:
                    Memoization techniques, such as React's React.memo or custom memoization strategies, work well with pure components.
                    In summary, pure functions in React, often represented by functional components, adhere to the principles of functional programming. They contribute to a more predictable, modular, and maintainable codebase, and they play a key role in React's performance optimizations.`,

const PureComponent = (props) => {
// No side effects, only depends on the input props

          <b>Code splitting</b> is a performance optimization technique in React where the application's JavaScript code is divided into smaller chunks, allowing parts of the app to be loaded only when they are needed, rather than loading the entire app at once.

          Code splitting is a technique in web development, especially within single-page applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, that involves dividing your application's code into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of loading the entire application's code at once, code splitting enables you to load only the code that's needed for the initial render or for specific user interactions.
          
          <b>The benefits of code splitting are</b>:
The speed at which a website loads and displays content becomes faster.
The interaction time improves.
The percentage of users who abandon the web page without interacting with it decreases.

          Dynamic <b>imports</b> in React allow you to dynamically load JavaScript modules at runtime, which can significantly improve your application's performance and load times. This technique is particularly useful for code splitting and lazy loading, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded when needed.

The import() function returns a Promise that resolves to the module you want to use dynamic import.
A normal import in JavaScript (using the <b>import</b> statement) does not return a Promise. It's a synchronous operation and returns the exported values from the imported module.

          <b>How It Works?</b>(Ex : 1)
✔️ We store the dynamically imported component in state (Component).
✔️ Clicking the button triggers import() manually.
✔️ No need for <b>Suspense</b> since React treats it as a normal component.


<b>How This Works</b>Ex : 2:
✔️ import() loads the module asynchronously.
✔️ setDynamicComponent() updates state only when the module is loaded.
✔️ React rerenders the component once it's available.`,

For example, you can initially load the components and modules related to user login and registration. Then, you can load the rest of the components based on user navigation.
                    
                    lazy lets you defer loading component's code until it is rendered for the first time.
<span style="color:red"> const SomeComponent = lazy(load) </span>
Call <b>lazy</b> outside your components to declare a lazy-loaded React component:
<span style="color:red">
import { lazy } from 'react';
// Dynamic import using \`default\` export
const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));</span>

<b>Default in Dynamic Imports in React</b>
The <b>default</b> keyword in a <b>dynamic import</b> is related to <b>default exports</b> in JavaScript ES6.

In JavaScript, when a module exports a single value, it can be exported as a <b>default export</b>. You can use the <b>default</b> keyword in dynamic imports to refer to the default export of the module.

<b>Parameters</b> 
<b>load</b>: A function that returns a Promise or another thenable (a Promise-like object with a <b>then</b> method). React will not call <b>load</b> until the first time you attempt to render the returned component. After React first calls <b>load</b>, it will wait for it to resolve, and then render the resolved value's <b>.default</b> as a React component. Both the returned Promise and the Promise's resolved value will be cached, so React will not call <b>load</b> more than once. If the Promise rejects, React will <b>throw</b> the rejection reason for the nearest Error Boundary to handle.
<b>Returns </b>
<b>lazy</b> returns a React component you can render in your tree. While the code for the lazy component is still loading, attempting to render it will suspend. Use <b> &lt;Suspense&gt; </b> to display a loading indicator while it's loading.

<b>Lazy Loading in React JS</b> helps to optimize the performance of React applications. The data is only rendered when visited or scrolled it can be images, scripts, etc. Lazy loading helps to load the web page quickly and presents the limited content to the user that is needed for the interaction lazy loading can be more helpful in applications that have high-resolution images or data that alters the loading time of the application.

<b>Lazy Loading in React</b>:
Lazy loading is a technique in React that allows you to load components, modules, or assets asynchronously, improving the loading time of your application. React provides a built-in React.lazy() method and Suspense component to achieve lazy loading.

1) <b>Code-Splitting</b>: You split your code into smaller chunks, typically by creating separate bundles for different parts of your application.
2) <b>Dynamic Import</b>: Instead of importing components directly at the top of your file, you use dynamic import() to import them only when they are needed.
3) <b>React.lazy()</b>: You wrap the dynamic import() call with React.lazy(), which allows React to render a fallback component while the requested component is being loaded.

<b>Steps to Implement Lazy Loading</b>:
Recognize the component you want to Lazy Load. These are mostly Large or complex which is not necessary for all the users when the page loads.
Import the <b>lazy()</b> and Suspense components from the React package
Use the <b>lazy()</b> function to dynamically import the component you want to lazy load:
Note that the argument to the <b>lazy()</b> function should be a function that returns the result of the import() function. 
Wrap the lazy-loaded component in a <b>Suspense</b> component, which will display a fallback UI while the component is being loaded:

<b>React.lazy()</b>
React.lazy() allows developers to easily create components with dynamic imports and render them as normal components. When the component is rendered, it will automatically load the bundle that contains the rendered component.

You need to provide a single input parameter to call <b>React.lazy()</b>. It accepts a function as an input parameter, and that function should return a promise after loading the component using <b>import()</b>. Finally, the returned promise from <b>React.lazy()</b> will give you a module with a default export containing the React component.

<b>Advantages of Lazy Loading</b>
=> Reduces initial loading time by reducing the bundle size.
=> Reduces browser workload.
=> Improves application performance in low bandwidth situations.
=> Improves user experience at initial loading.
=> Optimizes resource usage.
<b>advantages</b>:
<u>Faster Initial Load Time</u>: By only loading the necessary components when they are needed, lazy loading reduces the initial bundle size of your application. This results in faster load times, especially for large applications with many components or heavy assets.
<u>Improved Performance</u>: Smaller initial bundle sizes lead to quicker parsing and execution by the browser, resulting in improved overall performance. Users experience faster page load times and smoother interactions, particularly on slower networks or devices.
<u>Reduced Network Usage</u>: Lazy loading decreases the amount of data transferred over the network during the initial page load. This can be beneficial for users on limited data plans or slower connections, as it reduces the time required to download and render the initial content.
<u>Optimized Resource Usage</u>: Components or resources that are not immediately needed are deferred until they are required, optimizing resource usage and minimizing memory consumption. This can help improve the efficiency of your application, especially on devices with limited resources.
<u>Enhanced User Experience</u>: By prioritizing the loading of critical content and deferring non-essential components, lazy loading can enhance the user experience. Users can interact with the core functionality of the application more quickly, leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement.
<u>Scalability and Maintainability</u>: Lazy loading promotes a modular approach to development, allowing you to split your codebase into smaller, more manageable chunks. This makes it easier to maintain and scale your application over time, as you can add new features or components without significantly impacting the initial load time.


<b>Disadvantages of Lazy Loading</b>
=> Not suitable for small-scale applications.
=> Placeholders can slow down quick scrolling.
=> Requires additional communication with the server to fetch resources.
=> Can affect SEO and ranking.

        {
          text1: `<b>Understanding Bundle Splitting</b>
Bundle Splitting is the process of taking a single, massive JavaScript file (the "bundle") and breaking it into several smaller files (chunks).
Bundle splitting breaks your single large JS bundle into <b>Multiple smaller chunks</b> that load on demand, reducing the initial paylod the browser must download before the app becomes interactive

The goal is to <b>improve Initial Load</b> Time and <b>Caching Efficiency</b>. In a large application, if you change one line of code in a component, you don't want the user to have to re-download the entire React library or your third-party dependencies.
In a React application powered by Webpack, bundle splitting is the strategic separation of your code to ensure the browser doesn't download a single, massive file on the first load.
Webpack, a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications, offers built-in support for code-splitting. It provides a seamless way to create dynamic bundles that are loaded on demand, revolutionizing the way we optimize web applications.

<b>Why optimize webpack build?</b>
Main goals:
Reduce bundle size
Improve initial load time
Improve browser caching
Reduce rebuild time
Improve production performance

Production mode automatically enables several optimizations like minification, tree shaking, and dead code elimination.

In webpack optimization, I mainly focus on <b>tree shaking, splitChunks, dynamic imports, caching with content hashes, runtime chunk separation, and compression</b>. I also analyze bundles to identify heavy dependencies and optimize build performance using filesystem caching and efficient loader configuration.

<b>*** Tree shaking ***</b>
Tree shaking is an optimization technique in webpack that removes unused exports from JavaScript modules during the production build.
Tree shaking in webpack is a production optimization technique that removes unused exported code from the final JavaScript bundle. It works mainly with ES module syntax (import/export) and helps reduce bundle size and improve performance.

Tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique used in JavaScript bundlers to remove unused code from the final bundle.
<b>How it works</b>
When you import a module, tree shaking analyzes which exports are actually used in your code and strips out everything else. The name comes from the metaphor of shaking a tree so dead leaves (unused code) fall off.

---------
// math.js — exports three functions
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
export const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

// app.js — only uses one
import { add } from './math.js';
console.log(add(2, 3));
-----------
After tree <b>shaking</b>, <b>subtract</b> and multiply are not included in the bundle.
Key requirements
<b>1. ES Modules (ESM) syntax</b> — Tree shaking relies on <b>import/export</b> being static (analyzable at build time). CommonJS (<b>require</b>) is dynamic and largely defeats it.
Must use ES Modules (ESM)
<b>2. A bundler that supports it</b> — Rollup, Webpack (v2+), esbuild, and Vite all do tree shaking out of the box.
<b>3. sideEffects hints</b> — In <b>package.json</b>, you can tell bundlers a package has no side effects, enabling more aggressive shaking:
sideEffects in webpack is a configuration in <b>package.json</b> that tells webpack whether a module has side effects or not. If set to <b>false</b>, webpack assumes files are pure and can safely remove unused exports during tree shaking. If some files do side effects like CSS imports or global changes, we list them so webpack does not remove them.

sideEffects is defined in the root-level <b>package.json</b> file. It tells webpack which files should not be removed during tree shaking because they produce side effects like CSS imports or global script execution.

<b>🔷 What is a “Side Effect”?</b>
A side effect means:
👉 A file does something besides exporting code

Examples:
-> Injecting CSS into the page
-> Modifying window object
-> Running code immediately on import
-> Polyfills

<b>Example 1 (Side effect file)</b>
--------
// analytics.js
console.log("Analytics initialized");

window.trackEvent = function () {
  console.log("Tracking event");
};
----------
👉 Even if you don’t import functions, just importing this file runs code.

<b>Example 2 (CSS import)</b>
import "./styles.css";
This doesn’t export anything, but:
-> It injects styles into the page
👉 This is a side effect

<b>🔷 Why webpack needs sideEffects?</b>
Webpack tries to remove unused code (tree shaking).
But sometimes removing a file breaks the app:

Example:
import "./polyfills.js";
If webpack removes it thinking “not used”, app breaks ❌
So we tell webpack:
“Don’t remove this file, it has side effects.”

<b>Real-Time Example in React</b>
Instead of:
import _ from "lodash";
Use:
import debounce from "lodash/debounce";
Or libraries that support tree shaking:
import { Button } from "antd";
Unused components can be removed from bundle.

<b>1. No side effects at all (best for pure libraries)</b>
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
👉 Means:
Every file is safe to remove if unused
Maximum tree shaking

<b>2. Some files have side effects</b>
{
  "sideEffects": [
    "*.css",
    "./src/polyfills.js"
  ]
}
👉 Means:
-> CSS files → keep always
-> polyfills.js → keep always
-> other JS → can be removed if unused

<b>🔷 Real React Example</b>
❌ Bad (no tree shaking)
import "antd";
👉 imports entire library

✅ Good (tree shaking works)
import { Button } from "antd";
👉 only Button is included in bundle

🔷 Why it is important

<b>Without sideEffects</b>:
-> webpack may incorrectly remove needed files ❌
With sideEffects:
-> safer tree shaking
-> optimized bundle size
-> better performance

<b>Avoid Barrel Imports (Sometimes)</b>
Bad:
import { Button } from "@mui/material";

Better:
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";

Some libraries may include extra unused code.
Tools like Bundle Analyzer (webpack-bundle-analyzer, rollup-plugin-visualizer) let you inspect what made it into your final bundle and spot opportunities to reduce size

It's configured under <b>optimization.splitChunks</b> in <b>webpack.config.js.</b>

splitChunks is a Webpack optimization feature used to <b>split your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks automatically</b>, instead of putting everything into one big file.

<b>splitChunks</b> in Webpack is used to automatically split the bundle into smaller chunks like vendor and common chunks to improve caching, performance, and reduce initial load time.

<b>It helps improve</b>:
Page load speed
Caching efficiency
Code reusability

In Webpack config:

--------------
<b>🔹 Why splitChunks is needed?</b>
<b>Without it</b>:
One huge bundle.js
Even unused code is loaded
Poor caching (small change = full re-download)

<b>With splitChunks</b>:
Common code is separated
Vendor libraries (React, lodash) go into separate chunk
Only required code loads per page.

<b>Before splitChunks</b>:
bundle.js (React + App code + utilities + libraries)
<b>After splitChunks</b>:
vendor.js   → React, Redux
common.js   → shared utilities
app.js      → your application code


<b>🔹 Types of chunks created</b>
<b>Vendor chunk</b> → third-party libraries
<b>Common chunk </b>→ shared code across pages
<b>Async chunk </b>→ dynamic imports (import())

<b>cacheGroups</b>
Rules for creating separate bundles
<b>Using cacheGroups, you can create</b>:
vendors.js  → React + Redux
charts.js   → Chart.js
common.js   → shared utilities

Key Options
\`chunks\` — which chunks to optimize:

\`async\` (default) — only lazy-loaded chunks
\`initial\` — only synchronously imported chunks
\`all\` — both (recommended)

\`minSize\` — minimum size (bytes) for a chunk to be generated (default: 20000)
\`maxSize\` — tries to split chunks larger than this value (split larger chunks)
\`minChunks\` — minimum number of times a module must be shared before splitting (default: 1)
\`maxInitialRequests / maxAsyncRequests\`— limits parallel requests

Browser caches these files.
Later you deploy new code.

<b>Problem</b>:

<b>🔹 Solution → Content Hash</b>
Webpack generates unique hash based on file content.

Notice:

vendors.js hash stayed same
🔹 Browser behavior
Browser sees:

          In enterprise apps:
          -> Product thumbnails → lazy loaded
          -> Hero image → preloaded

          Image optimization in React/Web applications is mainly about:
-> Reducing image size
-> Loading images only when needed
-> Serving correct image formats
-> Improving Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FCP)

This is a very common frontend interview topic.
<b>1. Why Image Optimization is Important</b>
<b>Large images increase</b>:
-> Bundle size
-> Page load time
-> Network usage
-> LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

<b>Bad image optimization causes</b>:
-> Slow initial render
-> Layout shifts
-> Poor mobile performance

<b>2. Use Modern Image Formats</b>
<b>Old Formats</b>
JPEG
PNG

<b>Modern Formats</b>
WebP
AVIF

<b>They provide</b>:
Smaller size
Better compression
Faster loading

<b>3. Lazy Loading Images</b>
Load images only when they enter viewport.

Without Lazy Loading
All images load immediately.
With Lazy Loading
Only visible images load first.

&lt;img
  src=&quot;/products/shoe.webp&quot;
  alt=&quot;shoe&quot;
  loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
/&gt;

<b>4. Responsive Images</b>
Serve different image sizes for different devices.
&lt;img
  src=&quot;small.jpg&quot;
  srcSet=&quot;
    small.jpg 480w,
    medium.jpg 768w,
    large.jpg 1200w
  &quot;
  sizes=&quot;
    (max-width: 768px) 100vw,
    50vw
  &quot;
  alt=&quot;banner&quot;
/&gt;

Why?
Mobile should not download desktop-size images.

<b>5. Use Width & Height Properly</b>
Always specify dimensions.

&lt;img
  src=&quot;/banner.webp&quot;
  width=&quot;1200&quot;
  height=&quot;500&quot;
  alt=&quot;banner&quot;
/&gt;

This prevents:
CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)

Interview line:
Setting width and height reserves layout space and prevents UI shifting.

<b>6. CDN for Images</b>
Use CDN like:
-> Cloudflare
-> Cloudinary
-> ImageKit
-> AWS S3 + CloudFront

Benefits:
-> Faster global delivery
-> Automatic compression
-> Caching
-> Resizing

<b>7. Use Compression Tools</b>
Before uploading:
Compress images

Popular tools:
TinyPNG
Squoosh

<b>8. Use Skeleton or Blur Placeholder</b>
Instead of blank space:
{loading ? &lt;Skeleton /&gt; : &lt;img src={url} /&gt;}

Modern apps show:
Blur placeholder
Skeleton loading
Improves perceived performance.

<b>Interview Definition</b>
Preload in React is a performance optimization technique used to instruct the browser to fetch critical resources early before they are normally discovered during rendering.

<b>Important Points for Interview</b>
<b>1. Preload is browser feature, not React feature</b>
-> React itself does not provide preload directly.
-> It is handled by the browser using:
&lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&gt;

<b>2. Used for critical resources only</b>
Do not preload too many files because:
  -> It increases network competition
  -> Can hurt performance instead of improving it


<b>Prefetching (rel="prefetch")</b>
Prefetch is a resource hint that tells the browser to download resources in advance for future navigation.
It is used for resources that may be needed on the next page or future user actions.
Prefetched resources are downloaded with low priority during the browser’s idle time.
Example:
<b>&lt;link rel=&quot;prefetch&quot; href=&quot;/about.js&quot; as=&quot;script&quot; /&gt;</b>
<b>Short Interview Definition</b>
Prefetch is used to load non-critical resources for future pages in advance, improving navigation speed and user experience.

<b>Real-time Example in React</b>
Suppose your React app has:
-> Home Page
-> Product Page
When the user is on the Home Page, the browser can prefetch:
-> Product page JavaScript bundle
-> Product images
-> API data
So when the user clicks “Products”:
-> Page loads much faster
-> Navigation feels instant
 



<b>1. Magic Comments</b>
Those are "Magic Comments" specifically designed for the Webpack bundler. Because Vite uses a completely different engine (Rollup for production and esbuild for development), it doesn't recognize those specific names.

Vite does not use webpackPrefetch or webpackPreload.
<b>(The Webpack Era)</b>
In Webpack, you used these comments inside a dynamic import() to tell the bundler how to handle the new chunk:
<b>/* webpackPrefetch: true */</b>: Told Webpack to add <link rel="prefetch"> to the HTML head. It was low priority (for future use).
<b>/* webpackPreload: true */</b>: Told Webpack to add <link rel="preload"> to the HTML head. It was high priority (for immediate use).

          <b>preconnect</b>	Open connection early
<b>preload</b>	Download important resource immediately
<b>prefetch</b>	Download resource for future navigation

preconnect is a browser optimization technique used in React (or any web app) to establish an early connection to another domain before the actual request happens.

It helps improve loading performance for external resources like:
Fonts
APIs
CDN files
Analytics scripts

<b>Why use preconnect?</b>
Normally, when the browser requests a resource from another domain, it must first:
DNS lookup
TCP connection
SSL/TLS handshake

<b>These steps take time.</b>
preconnect tells the browser:
“Start the connection early because we’ll need this domain soon.”
So when the actual resource is requested later, it loads faster.

<b>Example in React</b>
Inside public/index.html (or index.html in Vite):
&lt;link rel=&quot;preconnect&quot; href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;preconnect&quot; href=&quot;https://fonts.gstatic.com&quot; crossorigin /&gt;

Then later:
&lt;link
  href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&amp;display=swap&quot;
  rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
/&gt;

Here:
preconnect creates the connection early
Font loads faster later
Common Use Cases
<b>Google Fonts</b>
&lt;link rel=&quot;preconnect&quot; href=&quot;https://fonts.gstatic.com&quot; crossorigin /&gt;
<b>API Server</b>
&lt;link rel=&quot;preconnect&quot; href=&quot;https://api.example.com&quot; /&gt;
<b>CDN</b>
&lt;link rel=&quot;preconnect&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net&quot; /&gt;

<b>Important Note</b>
Use preconnect only for critical third-party domains.
Too many preconnects can:
Waste browser connections
Reduce performance instead of improving it

      title: "Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Code Splitting",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `<b>What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?</b>
Server-side rendering (SSR) is the technique where the HTML of a web page is generated on the server rather than in the browser. When a user requests a page, the server sends a fully rendered HTML page to the browser, which is then displayed to the user. This contrasts with client-side rendering (CSR), where the browser loads an empty HTML page and then uses JavaScript to render the content dynamically.

Server-side rendering (SSR) is when a web server generates the full HTML of a page before sending it to the browser, rather than having the browser build it using JavaScript.

<b>How it works</b>:
User requests a page
Server fetches data, renders the HTML, and sends the complete page
Browser displays it immediately — no waiting for JS to run

<b>Contrast with client-side rendering (CSR)</b>:
In CSR (typical React/SPA apps), the server sends a near-empty HTML shell, then the browser downloads JS, runs it, fetches data, and then renders the page
In SSR, the user sees content much sooner

<b>Key benefits</b>:
-> Faster initial load — content is visible right away
-> Better SEO — search engines can read the fully-rendered HTML
-> Works without JS — content is accessible even if JS fails

<b>Trade-offs</b>:
-> More server load (the server does more work per request)
-> Can feel slower on navigation between pages (unless combined with hydration)
-> More complex infrastructure

<b>Modern hybrid approach</b>: Frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit blend SSR with client-side interactivity — the first page load is server-rendered, then the browser "hydrates" it and takes over for subsequent navigation. This gives you the best of both worlds.

<b>Drawbacks of Server-Side Rendering</b>
<b>1. Higher Server Load</b>
Every page request requires the server to fetch data, render HTML, and respond — all before sending anything. Under heavy traffic, this puts significant strain on your servers and increases hosting costs.
<b>2. Slower Page Transitions</b>
After the initial load, navigating to a new page triggers a full round-trip to the server (request → render → response). This can feel sluggish compared to CSR apps, where navigation is instant since only data is fetched, not a whole new page.
<b>3. Time to Interactivity (TTI) Gap</b>
SSR sends HTML quickly, so the user sees content fast — but the page isn't interactive until JavaScript downloads and "hydrates" it. This creates a frustrating window where buttons and links are visible but don't work yet.
<b>4. Increased Complexity</b>
SSR requires more moving parts — a running server, server-side data fetching logic, caching strategies, and careful handling of things that only exist in the browser (like window or localStorage). This raises development and operational overhead.
<b>5. Caching is Harder</b>
Static files (CSR) are trivially cached on a CDN. SSR responses are dynamic and personalized, making caching trickier. Without a smart caching strategy, every user gets a fresh server render, which is expensive.
<b>6. Scalability Challenges</b>
Because each request demands server computation, scaling an SSR app under traffic spikes requires more infrastructure compared to a CSR app, which mostly serves static files.
<b>7. Latency Sensitivity</b>
The rendered page is only as fast as your slowest data source. If the server needs to call a slow database or API before rendering, the user waits — whereas CSR apps can show a skeleton/loader immediately.`,

      note: [
        {
          text1: `In React.js, <b>virtualization</b> (also called <b>windowing</b>) is a <b>performance optimization technique</b> used when rendering large lists or tables.

          Virtualization is a performance optimization technique where React renders only the visible items instead of the entire list. Libraries like <b>react-window</b> help reduce DOM nodes, memory usage, and improve scrolling performance.

Instead of rendering <b>all items in a list</b> into the DOM (which is slow and memory-heavy), virtualization renders <b>only the visible portion</b> of the list (plus a small buffer). As the user scrolls, React dynamically reuses and recycles DOM nodes for visible items, instead of creating thousands of DOM elements at once.

&lt;ul&gt;
  {Array.from({ length: 10000 }).map((_, index) =&gt; (
    &lt;li key={index}&gt;Row {index}&lt;/li&gt;
  ))}
&lt;/ul&gt;


React creates 10,000 &lt;li&gt; elements in the DOM, which causes:
Slow rendering
High memory usage
Janky scrolling

Virtualization in React means rendering only what the user sees, instead of rendering the entire list at once.

<b>Solution With Virtualization</b>
Using virtualization, only the rows that are visible in the viewport (say 20 at a time) are rendered.
Popular libraries:
<b>react-window</b> (lightweight, recommended)
<b>react-virtualized</b> (older, more features)

<b>Benefits of Virtualization</b>
🚀 Performance boost (fast rendering & scrolling)
📉 Reduced DOM nodes (only render visible items)
🧠 Less memory usage
⚡ Better user experience (smooth scrolling)


<b>🚀 react-window Flow (Step by Step)</b>
<b>1. You give a big dataset</b>
rowCount = 10000
You are saying:

“I have 10,000 rows”
But React does NOT render all.

<b>2. You give container size</b>
height = 400
rowHeight = 50

Library calculates:
visible rows = 400 / 50 = 8 rows
So only ~8 rows fit on screen.

<b>3. Only visible rows are rendered</b>
At first render:
Row 0
Row 1
Row 2
...
Row 7
Only these exist in DOM.

<b>4. Fake scroll space is created</b>
Even though only 8 rows exist,
react-window creates a big scroll area:

total height = 10000 * 50 = 500000px
So scrollbar behaves like full list exists.

<b>5. Each row is positioned absolutely</b>
Each row gets a computed style:

style = {
  position: "absolute",
  top: index * rowHeight,
  height: rowHeight
}
So rows are placed exactly where they should be.

<b>6. On scroll → visible window changes</b>
When user scrolls:
Before:
Row 0 - 7
After scroll:
Row 50 - 57
Old rows are removed, new rows are rendered.

<b>7. DOM is recycled (important)</b>
Instead of creating new elements every time:
old row components are reused
only data changes
This keeps performance fast.

<b>8. Your Row component is reused</b>
({ index, style, data }) => {

                  <b>In functional component</b>
                  To run logic when a functional component is mounted, you can use the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array []. This ensures that the effect will only run once, right after the initial render — effectively mimicking componentDidMount() in class components.

                  <b>Updating</b>: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.

                  <b>Unmounting</b>: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.

                  It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows Render The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

      title: "vue js vs React js",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Vue.js and React.js are both popular JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces, but they have some differences in terms of design philosophy, syntax, and approach to certain features. Here are some key distinctions between Vue.js and React.js:

                  <b>Learning Curve</b>:
                  Vue.js: Vue has a gentle learning curve, making it relatively easy for beginners to pick up. Its template syntax is similar to HTML, which can be advantageous for developers familiar with web development basics.
                  React.js: React has a steeper learning curve, especially for beginners. Concepts like JSX (JavaScript XML) and the emphasis on a unidirectional data flow may require some adjustment for developers new to the framework.

                  <b>Syntax</b>:
                  Vue.js: Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax that is familiar to many developers. Templates are written in plain HTML with Vue-specific directives.
                  React.js: React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript. JSX allows you to write HTML elements and components directly within your JavaScript code, providing a more expressive way to describe the UI.

                  <b>Data Binding</b>:
                  Vue.js: Vue supports both one-way and two-way data binding. It has a v-model directive for two-way binding and provides easy syntax for handling state changes in components.
                  React.js: React primarily uses one-way data binding. Data flows from parent components to child components through props. React does not have built-in two-way binding, emphasizing a unidirectional data flow.

                  <b>State Management</b>:
                  Vue.js: Vue has a built-in state management system that allows you to manage local component state. For more complex state management, Vue can be integrated with Vuex, a state management library.
                  React.js: React uses a unidirectional data flow and relies on state and props to manage component data. For larger applications, Redux or other state management libraries are commonly used with React.

                  <b>Component Structure</b>:
                  Vue.js: Vue components are more flexible in terms of structure, and the framework provides a clear and concise way to define components, templates, and styles.
                  React.js: React components are typically written using JSX and often include separate files for CSS styles. React encourages a modular and reusable component structure.

                  <b>Community and Ecosystem</b>:
                  Vue.js: Vue has a growing and active community, but it is generally smaller than the React community. However, it has gained popularity rapidly, and there is a good ecosystem of libraries and tools.
                  React.js: React has a large and well-established community with a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources. It is widely adopted by many large companies and has strong community support.
                  Ultimately, the choice between Vue.js and React.js often depends on factors such as personal preference, project requirements, and the specific needs of the development team. Both frameworks are capable of building powerful and efficient user interfaces.

          text1: `React and Angular are both popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries for building web applications, but they have several differences in terms of architecture, approach, language, and other aspects. Here's a summary of the key differences between React and Angular:

                <b>1. Architecture</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Focuses on the "View" part of the application architecture.
                Follows a component-based architecture where UIs are built using components.
                React does not prescribe a specific architectural pattern, allowing developers to choose their preferred state management solutions (e.g., Redux, MobX).
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.
                Provides a more opinionated and structured approach with clear separation of concerns.
                Enforces a specific architecture with modules, components, services, and directives.

                <b>2. Language</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Written in JavaScript and can be used with JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax.
                Supports ES5, ES6, and TypeScript.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Primarily written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.
                TypeScript introduces static typing, decorators, and additional features.

                <b>3. Data Binding</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Uses one-way data binding. Data flows from parent components to child components.
                Emphasizes a unidirectional data flow.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Supports two-way data binding, allowing changes in the UI to automatically update the model and vice versa.
                Simplifies synchronization between the model and the view.

                <b>4. Dependency Injection</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Does not have built-in support for dependency injection.
                Props drilling is a common pattern to pass data down the component tree.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Has a built-in dependency injection system that facilitates the injection of services into components.
                Promotes modularity and testability.

                <b>5. Rendering</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed.
                Provides a reconciliation algorithm to optimize updates.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Uses a real DOM and updates the entire DOM when there are changes.
                Employs change detection to track and update components based on changes in the data.

                <b>6. Learning Curve</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Generally considered easier to learn, especially for developers familiar with JavaScript.
                Has a more gradual learning curve.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Has a steeper learning curve due to its opinionated nature and the introduction of TypeScript.
                Requires understanding of various concepts like modules, decorators, services, etc.

                <b>7. Tooling</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Can be used with various build tools (e.g., Webpack) and task runners.
                Developers have the flexibility to choose tools based on their preferences.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Comes with a comprehensive CLI (Command Line Interface) that automates common development tasks.
                Enforces a specific project structure and simplifies development workflows.

                <b>8. Community and Ecosystem</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Large and active community.
                Extensive ecosystem with a variety of third-party libraries and tools.
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Backed by Google, has strong community support.
                Comprehensive ecosystem with built-in tools for testing, animations, etc.

                <b>9. Size and Performance</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Lightweight core. The size of the final bundle depends on additional libraries used (e.g., state management libraries).
                <u>Angular</u>:
                Larger bundle size compared to React due to the framework's features.
                Supports Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for improved performance.

                <b>10. Flexibility</b>:
                <u>React</u>:
                Offers more flexibility in terms of choosing libraries and tools.
                Developers have more control over the architecture.

                <u>Angular</u>:
                Provides a more opinionated and structured approach.
                Offers less flexibility but more guidance for building large-scale applications.

                Conclusion:
                The choice between React and Angular depends on project requirements, team expertise, and developer preferences. React is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration, while Angular provides a more opinionated and structured framework with a full set of features out of the box. Each has its strengths, and the decision often comes down to the specific needs of the project and the development`,

              <b>1. Purpose</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              The Shadow DOM is primarily designed for encapsulation. It allows developers to create isolated and encapsulated components with scoped styles and markup. The main goal is to prevent style and DOM structure leakage from one component to another.
              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              The virtual DOM is a performance optimization technique. It provides an in-memory representation of the actual DOM to efficiently update the UI by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM. The focus is on improving rendering efficiency and reducing unnecessary reflows and repaints.

              <b>2. Isolation</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              Provides encapsulation by isolating the styles and structure of a component. Styles defined within the Shadow DOM are scoped to the component, and the DOM structure is not accessible from the outside.
              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              Does not provide encapsulation or isolation of styles. Its primary goal is to optimize updates to the UI by reducing the number of direct manipulations to the real DOM.

              <b>3. Usage</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              Typically used in the context of web components. It allows developers to create reusable and encapsulated components that can be composed without worrying about style or DOM conflicts.
              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              Widely used in libraries and frameworks like React. It is employed to efficiently update the UI by comparing the differences between consecutive states and applying minimal changes to the real DOM.

              <b>4. Concerns</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              Addresses encapsulation, style scoping, and DOM structure isolation. It ensures that the styles of one component do not affect others and that the DOM structure is self-contained.
              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              Focuses on performance optimization, reducing the cost of updating the UI by batching and efficiently applying changes to the real DOM.

              <b>5. Implementation</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              Created using the attachShadow method. It is commonly used with custom elements to encapsulate the styles and structure of a component.

              const shadowRoot = element.attachShadow({mode: 'open' });

              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              Created in memory as a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. It is used by libraries and frameworks like React to efficiently update the UI based on changes to component state.

              <b>6. Common Use Cases</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              Ideal for creating reusable and encapsulated web components. It is commonly used when developing component-based architectures.
              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              Widely used in applications where dynamic and frequent updates to the UI are required. Commonly employed in single-page applications built with libraries like React.

              <b>7. Framework/Library Support</b>:
              <u>Shadow DOM</u>:
              Supported in modern browsers and is used in conjunction with web components. It is not tied to any specific library or framework.
              <u>Virtual DOM</u>:
              Widely used in libraries and frameworks like React and Vue.js. The virtual DOM is a key concept in these frameworks for optimizing UI updates.

              In summary, while both the Shadow DOM and the virtual DOM are related to the DOM and web development, they serve different purposes. The Shadow DOM focuses on encapsulation and isolation of styles and structure, while the virtual DOM is a performance optimization technique for efficiently updating the UI by minimizing direct manipulations of the real DOM. They are often used in combination to achieve both encapsulation and performance benefits in web applications.`,

      note: [
        {
          text1: `Controlled components and uncontrolled components are two different approaches to managing and handling form elements and user input in React. The key differences lie in how they handle and manage the state of form elements.

            <b>Controlled Components</b>:
            <u>State is Managed by React</u>:
            In controlled components, the state of form elements (such as input fields) is managed by React using the useState hook (in functional components) or this.setState (in class components).
            The component's state serves as the single source of truth for the values of form elements.

            <u>Input Values are Controlled</u>:
            The values of form elements are tied to the component's state.
            User input triggers a change in the component's state, and the component re-renders to reflect the updated state.

            <u>Predictable Behavior</u>:
            Since the state is managed by React, the behavior is predictable and follows the React data flow model.
            The component's UI is always a reflection of its current state.


            <b>Uncontrolled Components</b>:
            <u>State is Managed by the DOM</u>:
            In uncontrolled components, the state of form elements is not managed by React. Instead, it is managed by the DOM itself.
            The component relies on refs to access and interact with the DOM nodes directly.

            <u>Input Values are Uncontrolled</u>:
            The values of form elements are not directly tied to the component's state. Instead, the component queries the DOM to get the current values.

            <u>Use Cases</u>:
            Uncontrolled components are often used when integrating with non-React code or when working with third-party libraries that manage their state internally.
            They might be suitable in situations where you want to minimize the amount of React-specific code.
            Choosing Between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components:

            <b>Controlled Components</b>:
            Provide a predictable and React-centric way of managing form state.
            Suitable for situations where React should have full control over form behavior.

            <b>Uncontrolled Components</b>:
            Useful in scenarios where you want to integrate React with non-React code or libraries.
            Can be simpler in some cases, especially when dealing with large and dynamic forms.
            The choice between controlled and uncontrolled components depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. In many cases, controlled components are the preferred choice in React applications due to their predictability and ease of integration with other React features.`,

      title: "How are state objects different from props objects?",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `In React, state and props are both mechanisms for managing data in a component, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
          
          <b>State</b>:
          <u>Definition</u>:
          State is a JavaScript object that represents the internal, mutable data of a component.
          It is managed and controlled by the component itself.
          Changes to state trigger a re-render of the component.
          <u>Mutability</u>:
          State is mutable and can be updated using the setState method.
          State changes trigger a re-render of the component, updating the UI.
          <u>Scope</u>:
          State is local to the component in which it is defined. It is not directly accessible by parent or child components.
          <u>Initialization</u>:
          State is typically initialized in the component's constructor method or, in functional components, using the useState hook.

          <b>Props</b>:
          <u>Definition</u>:
          Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component.
          They are immutable and cannot be modified by the component that receives them.
          Changes to props do not trigger a re-render of the component.
          <u>Immutability</u>:
          Props are immutable and cannot be modified within the component that receives them.
          They are read-only and serve as a way to configure and customize child components.
          <u>Scope</u>:
          Props are passed from parent components to child components. Child components cannot directly modify the props they receive.
          <u>Initialization</u>:
          Props are passed as attributes in JSX when a component is used.

          Key Differences:
          <b>Mutability</b>:
          State is mutable and can be updated by the component itself.
          Props are immutable and cannot be modified within the component that receives them.

          <b>Ownership</b>:
          State is owned and managed by the component itself.
          Props are passed from parent components and are owned by the parent.

          <b>Scope</b>:
          State is local to the component.
          Props are passed from parent to child and are accessible in the child component.

          <b>Triggering Re-renders</b>:
          Changes to state trigger re-renders of the component.
          Changes to props do not trigger re-renders. Components re-render only if their own state or props change.
          In summary, state is internal and mutable data managed by a component, while props are external and immutable data passed from parent components to child components. Understanding when to use state and when to use props is crucial for building effective and maintainable React applications.

      note: [
        {
          text1: `<b>1. React.memo()</b>
React.memo() is a higher-order component (HOC) used to optimize functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. It memorizes the component and only re-renders it if its props have changed.

<b>Usage</b>:
React.memo(Component) wraps a functional component and returns a memoized version of that component.

It will only re-render the component if the props passed to it have changed.

<b>When to use</b>:
Use React.memo() when you have a pure functional component that only depends on its props and doesn't have side effects or require internal state changes.

It’s useful when you have a component that receives complex objects or arrays as props that may not change often, as React would re-render it unnecessarily without memoization.

<b>Example</b>:
const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
  console.log("Rendering MyComponent");
  return &lt;div&gt;{props.value}&lt;/div&gt;;
});
export default MyComponent;

In this example, MyComponent will only re-render if props.value changes. If props.value remains the same between renders, React will skip rendering this component, thus improving performance.

<b>Props Comparison</b>:
By default, React.memo() does a shallow comparison of the props to determine if the component should re-render.
If you need a custom comparison, you can pass a second argument to React.memo():

React.memo(Component, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return prevProps.someProp === nextProps.someProp;
});

          text1: `<b>2. useMemo()</b>
<b>useMemo()</b> is a React hook that memorizes the result of a function (value calculation) between renders. It prevents the recalculation of a value unless the dependencies have changed.

<b>Usage</b>:
<b>useMemo(fn, deps)</b> takes a function <b>fn</b> and an array of dependencies <b>deps</b>. The value returned by <b>fn</b> is cached and will only be recalculated when any of the values in the dependency array <b>(deps)</b> change.

Unlike <b>React.memo()</b>, which is for <b>components</b>, <b>useMemo()</b> is for <b>values</b> (calculations, objects, arrays) inside components.

<b>When to use</b>:
Use <b>useMemo()</b> when you have expensive calculations or complex objects/arrays that don't need to be recalculated every render.
It's especially useful for preventing unnecessary recalculations of values when they depend on props or state that don't change on every render.


In this example, the <b>expensiveCalculation</b> function will only be called when num changes. Otherwise, the result will be reused, improving performance.`,

      note: [
        {
          text1: `Error boundaries are a feature in React that allows you to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in a component tree and log those errors, display a fallback UI, or perform other actions. Error boundaries are useful for preventing unhandled errors from crashing the entire React application.

          React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed

                    In React, errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, or in the constructors of the whole tree below them are considered uncaught errors. By default, if an error occurs in a component, it will propagate up the component tree until it reaches the root, causing the entire application to unmount.

                    Error boundaries work by defining special methods in a class component. When an error is thrown during the rendering or lifecycle methods of a component, the error is caught by the nearest error boundary and allows you to handle the error gracefully.


                    Any component which uses one of the following lifecycle methods is considered an error boundary.
                    In what places can an error boundary detect an error?

                    Render phase
                    Inside a lifecycle method
                    Inside the constructor

                    With error boundaries: As mentioned above, error boundary is a component using one or both of the following methods: static <b>getDerivedStateFromError</b> and <b>componentDidCatch.</b>

                    As of v16.2.0, there's no way to turn a functional component into an error boundary.

                    The React docs are clear about that, although you're free to reuse them as many times as you wish:

                    The <b>componentDidCatch()</b> method works like a JavaScript catch <b>{ }</b> block, but for components. Only class components can be error boundaries. In practice, most of the time you'll want to declare an error boundary component once and use it throughout your application.
                    
                    getDerivedStateFromError(): This lifecycle method renders a fallback UI after an error is thrown. It is called during the render phase, so side effects are not permitted
componentDidCatch(): This method is used to log error information. It is called during the commit phase, so side effects are permitted

      note: [
        {
          text1: ` #) A <b>side effect</b> is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. These can be, say, a network request, which has your code communicating with a third party

                    In React components, side effects are operations that affect the outside world :
        
                    => such as modifying the DOM or manually changing the DOM in React components,
                    => setting up a subscription,
                    => making API calls for Data fetching, or updating global state,
                    => Using unpredictable timing functions like setTimeout or setInterval
                    
                    Side effects can be classified into two types:
                    
                    <b> Synchronous side effects: </b> 
                    Synchronous side effects are the effects that happen immediately after the state of the component changes. These side effects are straightforward to manage, as they don't require any asynchronous processing or waiting for data.
                    Examples of synchronous side effects include:
                    
                    Changing the visibility of a component
                    Updating the text or content of a component
                    Showing or hiding an error message
                    
                    <b>Asynchronous side effects: </b>
                    Asynchronous side effects are the effects that happen after a delay or as a result of some external event, such as a user input or a network request. These side effects can be more complicated to manage than synchronous side effects, as they require asynchronous processing and state management.
                    Examples of asynchronous side effects include:
                    
                    Making an API call to fetch data
                    Updating the application state after receiving data from an API call
                    Setting a timer to run a function after a specified delay
                    To manage side effects in React components, developers can use the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook allows developers to perform side effects after rendering the component and to clean up any resources used by the effect. By using the useEffect hook, developers can manage both synchronous and asynchronous side effects in their components.

          text1: `Batching in React means grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.
“Batching in React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render to improve performance."

Instead of re-rendering the component after every state update, React combines multiple updates and renders once.

<b>Example:</b>
setCount(count + 1);
setName("Anand");

In React, these updates are batched, so the component re-renders only once instead of twice.

<b>Important points:</b>
- Improves performance by reducing unnecessary renders
- Automatic in React 18 (even in async operations)
- Before React 18, batching worked only inside event handlers
`,
          code1: `//🔥 Real-time example of batching in React
💡 //Scenario: Form update or button click
//Imagine you have a button that updates multiple states at once:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [name, setName] = useState("");

const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
  setName("Anand");
};

// 👉 What you might expect:
// First setCount → re-render
// Then setName → another re-render
// 👉 What actually happens (Batching):

// React groups both updates and does:
// 👉 only ONE re-render

// 🧠 Real-world use case
// Example: Login / API response
const handleLogin = async () => {
  const user = await loginAPI();

  setUser(user);
  setIsLoggedIn(true);
  setLoading(false);
};
// Without batching:
// 3 re-renders ❌
// With batching:
// 1 re-render ✅
// 👉 This improves performance a lot in real apps

//-------------
// ⚡ React 18 Advanced Behavior
// Before React 18:
// Batching worked only in event handlers

// After React 18:
// Batching works everywhere (even async)
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setName("React");
}, 1000);

// 👉 Now this also triggers only one re-render


//---------------
// 🚨 Important Interview Point
// Problem batching solves:

// 👉 “Too many unnecessary re-renders”

// Best practice:
// Use functional updates when multiple updates depend on previous state:

<b>What are component patterns in React?</b>
Component patterns are design approaches used to structure and reuse components efficiently.

<b>Common component patterns:</b>

1. Presentational and Container Pattern  
Presentational components handle UI  
Container components handle logic and data

2. Higher Order Components (HOC)  
A function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component

3. Render Props  
A component that shares logic via a function prop

4. Custom Hooks  
Reusable logic extracted into functions

<b>Example:</b>
Custom hook:
function useFetch(url) {
  // reusable API logic
}

<b>Key point:</b>
Component patterns improve reusability, readability, and maintainability.`,

          text1: `Apollo is a library that brings together two incredibly useful technologies used to build web and mobile apps: React and GraphQL.
          
          <b>Apollo Client</b> is a powerful, flexible, and comprehensive state management library for JavaScript applications, specifically designed to manage data fetching and cache synchronization in a GraphQL environment. It is the client-side counterpart of Apollo Server, which helps you query, mutate, and manage data in your GraphQL-enabled applications.

          React was made for creating great user experiences with JavaScript. GraphQL is a very straightforward and declarative new language to more easily and efficiently fetch and change data, whether it is from a database or even from static files.
          
          Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript. It enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.

Apollo Client helps you structure code in an economical, predictable, and declarative way that's consistent with modern development practices. `,
          code1: ``
        },
        {
          text1: `Apollo Client is UI framework agnostic, which is super beneficial. You could use it with Angular, Vue, React or even native iOS and Android applications. The frontend application sends the GraphQL query to the Apollo Client, which processes the query and requests data from the GraphQL server. Note that the Apollo Client is agnostic of your GraphQL server's technology. It is compatible across any build setup and GraphQL API.

The GraphQL server then sends the data response back to the Apollo Client. Which then normalizes and stores the data. The frontend application receives the UI updates. Apollo Client basically does some of the hard lifting work for the frontend application. It also provides intelligent caching out of the box.

<b>Integrate Apollo Client</b>
Installation
The very first step is to install the following packages.
npm install @apollo/client graphql

<b>apollo/client</b>: Contains everything you need to setup Apollo Client 
<b>graphql</b>: Provides logic for parsing GraphQL queries.

<b>Imports</b>
In the root of your app, which is usually index.js or App.js, let’s get the imports ready.

import {
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  ApolloProvider,
  useQuery,
  gql
} from "@apollo/client";

<b>Create Apollo Client</b>
initialize the Apollo Client within the app.

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: ”https://my-example-url.com”, // Your running GraphQL server URL
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

Within the root of your app, initialize an instance of the Apollo Client as shown above and provide it the GraphQL server URL. This can also be a local schema path.

<b>Connect Apollo Client to React with Apollo Provider</b>
The next step is to connect the Apollo Client to React with the Apollo Provider component. It wraps the React app and places the client on the context. This allows access to the Apollo Client from all the components within the app. Wrap the provider within the root of your application.
&lt;ApolloProvider client = {client}&gt;
  &lt;App /&gt;
&lt;/ApolloProvider&gt;

<b>Consume GraphQL API and Execute Queries</b>
The initial setup work is done. Now we are ready to actually consume the GraphQL API and request data using GraphQL queries.

<b>useQuery Hook</b>
Queries provides clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.

<i>The useQuery is a React hook, which is the API for executing queries in an Apollo application.</i>

First we write the GraphQL query that we want to execute, using the gql symbol. Below is the query, that queries for the fields we want to display on the conference sessions page.

const ALL_SESSIONS = gql\`
  query sessions {
    sessions {
    id
    title
    startsAt
    day
    room
    level
    speakers {
      id
      name
    }    
  }
}\`;

const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(ALL_SESSIONS);

The useQuery hook returns the loading and error states that are tracked by the Apollo Client. This will help the frontend component code for loading and error states to display to the user. When the result of the query comes back from the GraphQL Server, the data property is populated. The data property contains the json response from the GraphQL API.

Let’s add the hook to a component, this will ensure that when the component renders, the useQuery hook is executed. The AllSessionList component renders the sessions when the data is returned after executing the query. The loading sessions message is displayed briefly, until the data is returned.

function AllSessionList() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(ALL_SESSIONS);
  if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading Sessions..&lt;/p&gt;;
  if (error) return &lt;p&gt;Error loading sessions!&lt;/p&gt;;
  return data.sessions.map((session) => (
    &lt;SessionItem
      key={session.id}
      session={{
        ...session,
      }}
    /&gt;
  ));
}

<b>Native Browser API</b>
Fetch is built directly into modern web browsers, requiring no external libraries. This makes it lightweight and ideal for simple requests.
<b>Promise-based</b>
It uses Promises for asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner way to handle responses than older XMLHttpRequest.
<b>Manual JSON Parsing</b>
When receiving JSON data, you need to explicitly call response.json() to parse the response body.
<b>Error Handling</b>
Fetch only rejects a Promise on network errors (e.g., no internet connection). It does not reject on HTTP error status codes (like 404 or 500), requiring manual checks of response.ok or response.status.
<b>Limited Built-in Features</b>
Features like request cancellation, progress tracking, and interceptors require manual implementation using AbortController or other custom logic.

<b>Axios</b></b>
<b>Third-Party Library</b>
Axios is a popular JavaScript library that needs to be installed as a dependency.
<b>Feature-Rich</b>
It offers a more comprehensive set of features out-of-the-box, including
<b>Automatic JSON Transformation</b> Automatically parses JSON data in responses.
<b>Built-in Interceptors</b> Allows you to intercept requests and responses for global error handling, authentication, or logging.
<b>Request Cancellation</b> Provides a straightforward way to cancel ongoing requests.
<b>Built-in Timeout Functionality</b> Easily set timeouts for requests.
<b>Better Error Handling</b> Rejects promises for both network errors and HTTP error status codes, simplifying error management.

          text1: `<b>Micro Frontend Architecture in React JS</b> is a way of structuring a large React application by splitting it into smaller, independently developed, and deployed micro-frontends. These micro-frontends can be built using React or other frameworks, but in this case, we'll focus on React. Each part of the UI (or feature) is developed as a separate React app, which can be independently updated, deployed, and integrated into a larger, cohesive UI.
          
          <b>✅ Improved Version (Use this in interview)</b>
Micro Frontend is an architecture where a large frontend application is split into smaller, independently developed and deployed applications.
Each micro frontend represents a feature or domain, like cart, product listing, or payments, and is owned by a separate team.
These micro frontends are then integrated into a single UI either at build time or runtime using techniques like <b>Webpack Module Federation</b>, <b>Web Components</b>, or <b>iframes</b>.
This approach improves scalability, allows teams to work independently, and enables faster deployments without affecting the entire application.

<b>Got it — they’re specifically asking “Have you used Micro Frontend in React?</b>
In React, micro frontends are usually implemented using Webpack Module Federation, where each micro frontend is a separate React application.
Components are exposed from one app and consumed by another at runtime, enabling independent deployment and scalability.
In my previous project, while we didn’t use full micro frontends, we followed a modular architecture that aligns with these principles, and I’m confident in implementing it when required.

From a React perspective, I understand that micro frontends can be implemented using <b>Webpack 5 Module Federation</b>, where one React app exposes components and another consumes them at runtime.

<b>👉 How it works in React</b>
In React, each micro frontend is typically a separate React app. Using Module Federation, we can expose components from one app and dynamically import them into another app at runtime.

<b>💻 Small Code-Level Hint (very powerful in interviews)</b>
You don’t need full code, just say:
For example, in Module Federation, we define exposes in one app and remotes in another, and then load components using dynamic imports.

          <b>Key Concepts of Micro Frontend Architecture in React</b>:
<b>Componentization</b>:
In a typical React app, components are already modular. In a micro frontend setup, you take this concept further by breaking the app down into larger pieces, with each piece having its own separate React app or module.

<b>Independent Deployment</b>:
Each micro frontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. For example, the user profile page could be developed as a separate React app, the shopping cart as another, and they can each be deployed separately.

<b>Integration of Micro Frontends</b>:
The micro frontends need to be integrated at runtime to appear as one cohesive application. This can be done in a number of ways, like using single-spa, Module Federation (Webpack 5), or iframe-based integration.

<b>Shared State Management</b>:
Micro frontends need to communicate with each other and share states (like user authentication or shopping cart data). There are different ways to handle this, such as through <b>global stores</b> (e.g., using Redux or Context API) or <b> custom events.</b>

<b>How Micro Frontends Work in React</b>:
<b>1. Designing the Micro Frontends</b>:
Start by identifying the various features or domains of your app that can be isolated. For example:
-> Header (a navigation bar)
-> Product List
-> User Profile
-> Shopping Cart

Each of these can be a separate React app, developed by different teams if necessary.

<b>2. Choosing an Integration Method</b>:
There are several ways to integrate React micro frontends:

<b>i) Single-spa (Most Common Approach)</b>:
Single-spa is a popular JavaScript framework for orchestrating multiple micro frontends. It allows you to load multiple micro-frontends (even if they are built with different frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue) into the same application.

You configure each React app as a micro frontend, and then use single-spa to manage the routing, loading, and rendering of these apps.



<b>ii) Webpack Module Federation (for Shared Code)</b>:
Webpack 5 introduced Module Federation, which allows micro frontends to share code (like React or utility functions) at runtime. This is especially useful when you want to avoid duplicating common libraries or dependencies across micro frontends.


<b>iii) Iframe-Based Integration</b>:
You can also load each micro frontend as an iframe within the main application. This is a simpler, but less flexible, approach. However, it might be suitable for completely isolated micro-frontends or legacy apps that cannot be deeply integrated.

Example:
const IframeMicroFrontend = () => (
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://localhost:3001&quot; title=&quot;Product List&quot; /&gt;
);


<b>3. Communication Between Micro Frontends</b>:
<b>Global State Management</b>:
You can use React Context API, Redux, or MobX to manage shared state (like user authentication or the shopping cart). This helps ensure that all micro frontends can access and update shared data.


Example using React Context API:
const AppContext = React.createContext();

const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

<b>Custom Events or Pub/Sub Mechanism</b>:
Another approach to share data or trigger actions across micro frontends is through Custom Events or using a Pub/Sub system (e.g., RxJS, EventEmitter).

Example using custom events:
// Micro frontend A (emitting event)
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('userUpdated', { detail: { user } }));

// Micro frontend B (listening to event)
window.addEventListener('userUpdated', (e) => {
  const updatedUser = e.detail;
  // Update state or UI based on the new user data
});`,
          code1: `// Example of integration using single-spa:
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';

registerApplication(
  'header',
  () => import('./header-app'), // Dynamically load the header React app
  location => location.pathname === '/' // Only load when on homepage
);

registerApplication(
  'product-list',
  () => import('./product-list-app'),
  location => location.pathname === '/products'
);
start();



// Example of Webpack Module Federation configuration:
// webpack.config.js of Host Application
module.exports = {
  name: 'host-app',
  remotes: {
    'product-list': 'productListApp@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
  },
};

// webpack.config.js of Micro Frontend (Product List)
module.exports = {
  name: 'productListApp',
  exposes: {
    './ProductList': './src/ProductList',
  },
};
// Here, the host app dynamically imports the ProductList component from a remote micro frontend at runtime.`

          text1: `<b>🔷 Module Federation in Vite (Definition)</b>
Module Federation in Vite is a micro-frontend architecture approach that allows multiple independently built and deployed React applications to share and load modules (components, pages, utilities) at runtime using dynamic imports.

It enables a <b>host application</b> to consume code from one or more remote applications without bundling them together at build time.

Module Federation in Vite is a micro-frontend technique that allows multiple independently deployed Vite applications to dynamically share and load modules at runtime using a remote entry file, enabling scalable and decoupled frontend architecture.

<b>🔷 Simple Meaning</b>
👉 One React app can use code from another React app at runtime, even if they are:
built separately
deployed separately
hosted on different servers

<b>In Vite, Module Federation is enabled using</b>:
@originjs/vite-plugin-federation

It works by generating a remote entry file that exposes modules:
remoteEntry.js(example/default name)

This file tells the host app:
what modules are exposed
where they are located
how to load them dynamically

<b>🔷 Architecture</b>
Host App (React + Vite) - (Parent App)
        ↓
loads at runtime
        ↓
remoteEntry.js
        ↓
Remote App modules (Dashboard, Header, etc.)


<b>🔷 Why is Host called Parent?</b>
Loads other apps (remote apps)
Controls the UI layout (shell)
Acts as entry point for the user
Dynamically imports remote modules

<b>How &lt;Outlet /&gt;; works</b>
When you define a nested routing structure using <Route> components, the parent route's element acts as a wrapper or a layout for its children. The &lt;Outlet /&gt;; component inside that parent element determines exactly where the child component will be rendered. 

Think of &lt;Outlet /&gt;like a placeholder.
It says:
➡️ "If this parent route matches, show the child route component here."

How this works (WithAuthHOC.jsx )
<b>When you visit <u>/dashboard</u> </b>
1) React Router first checks Route element={&lt;WithAuthHOC /&gt;}
2) Inside <b>WithAuthHOC</b>:

so rendering multiple times is common  or issue

<b>In Redux with <u>createAsyncThunk</u> and the usual <u>pending / fulfilled / rejected</u> lifecycle</b>:
Yes, multiple renders are expected and normal because:
    When you dispatch an async thunk, first the <b>pending</b> action updates your state (usually to set <b>loading = true</b>).
    This triggers a render because the state changed.
    When the async request completes successfully, the <b>fulfilled</b> action updates the state again (e.g., updates <b>tasks</b> and sets <b>loading = false</b>).
    This triggers another render because the state changed again.
    If there's an error, the <b>rejected</b> action runs, updating error state and triggering a render.

<b>So the typical lifecycle causes multiple renders per async action:</b>
    Component renders initially.
    You dispatch fetchTasks.
    fetchTasks.pending updates state → render #1
    After API response, fetchTasks.fulfilled updates state → render #2
    If error: fetchTasks.rejected updates state → render #2 or another render

<b>What does this mean for your app?</b>
    // Multiple renders here are expected and not a problem.
    This is how React + Redux work together naturally.
    // The key is to keep your state updates minimal and efficient, so you don’t cause unnecessary renders beyond those triggered by meaningful state changes.
    // Avoid other state changes or props changes that cause even more renders beyond these lifecycle renders.

console.log(typeof undefined == typeof NULL);
Answer- The output logged will be: true
The reason is that NULL is different from primitive data type null. The variable NULL is just any other undefined variable. If we console log these three, we can see that typeof null and typeof NULL are different.
console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined
console.log(typeof null);  //object

40.. What’s the difference between event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() methods?
Answer: The event.preventDefault() the method prevents the default behavior of an element. If used in an form element it prevents it from submitting. While the event.stopPropagation() method stops the propagation of an event or stops the event from occurring in the bubbling or capturing phase.
41. Why meta tags are used in HTML?
Ans: Meta tags in HTML are used by the developer to tell the browser about the page description, author of the template, character set, keywords, and many more. Meta tags are used to tell the search engine about the page content for search engine optimization.
What would happen if the HTML document does not contain <!DOCTYPE>?
Ans: It instructs the Web Browser about the version of HTML used for creating the Web page. If the developer misses 
declaring the DOCTYPE information in the code, then new features and tags provided by HTML5 will not be supported.
Additionally, the Browser may automatically go into Quirks or Strict Mode.

      note: [
        {
          text1: `<b>What type of component is React?</b>
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It follows a component-based architecture where UI is broken into reusable components. React components can be functional or class-based, but modern React prefers functional components with hooks.

<b>Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?</b>
Controlled components are form elements whose value is managed by React state. Every change is handled via state updates using onChange events. Uncontrolled components store their own state in the DOM and are accessed using refs. Controlled components provide better control and validation, while uncontrolled components are simpler but less flexible.

<b>Optimization techniques in React?</b>
React optimization techniques include using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, useMemo for memoizing expensive calculations, and useCallback for memoizing functions. Other techniques include lazy loading components, code splitting, avoiding inline functions in JSX, and using virtualization for large lists.

<b>Difference between useCallback and useMemo?</b>
useCallback memoizes a function so that it does not get recreated on every render unless dependencies change. useMemo memoizes the result of a computation and returns the cached value. useCallback is used for functions, while useMemo is used for computed values.

<b>When to use useCallback and useMemo (with example)?</b>
useCallback is used when passing functions to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Example: const handleClick = useCallback(() => setCount(count + 1), [count]);

useMemo is used when performing expensive calculations.
Example: const total = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(data), [data]);

<b>useEffect with dependency and without dependency?</b>
useEffect without dependency array runs after every render. useEffect with an empty array runs only once on component mount. useEffect with dependencies runs whenever specified values change.

<b>How to stop infinite loop in useEffect?</b>
Infinite loops happen when state updates inside useEffect trigger re-renders continuously. To prevent this, ensure correct dependency arrays, avoid updating state unnecessarily, and use conditions inside useEffect.

<b>Why data is not showing in React UI?</b>
Common reasons include incorrect state updates, missing setState usage, asynchronous API not handled properly, missing dependency array in useEffect, or rendering before data is available.

<b>What is React.memo?</b>
React.memo is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-rendering of functional components by memoizing the rendered output based on props comparison.

<b>How to memoize a component?</b>
We use React.memo for components, useMemo for values, and useCallback for functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

<b>What other hooks have you used?</b>
Common React hooks include useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, useReducer, and custom hooks for reusable logic.

      note: [
        {
          text1: `<b>Difference between null and undefined?</b>
undefined means a variable is declared but not assigned a value. null is an intentional assignment representing "no value". undefined is default, null is explicit.

<b>What is closure?</b>
A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished execution. It allows data encapsulation and persistent state.

<b>What is a Promise?</b>
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

<b>async/await vs promises?</b>
Promises use .then() chaining while async/await provides a cleaner synchronous-like structure. async/await improves readability and error handling using try/catch.

<b>What is hoisting?</b>
Hoisting is JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during compilation.

<b>What is IIFE?</b>
Immediately Invoked Function Expression is a function that runs immediately after it is defined.

<b>What is call, apply, bind?</b>
call and apply invoke functions with a given this context. apply takes arguments as an array. bind returns a new function with fixed this context.

<b>What is prototype in JavaScript?</b>
Prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods in JavaScript.

<b>What is generator function?</b>
A generator function can pause execution using yield and resume later, allowing iterative execution control.

<b>What is event loop?</b>
Event loop handles asynchronous operations by moving callbacks from the callback queue to the call stack when it is empty.

<b>Temporal Dead Zone?</b>
TDZ is the time between variable declaration (let/const) and initialization where accessing the variable causes an error.`,

          text1: `<b>How does Redux work?</b>
Redux is a state management library that uses a single global store. Actions are dispatched to reducers, which update the state immutably, and the UI subscribes to store changes.

<b>Why can't we update Redux state directly?</b>
Redux enforces immutability. Direct mutation prevents predictable state updates and breaks time-travel debugging and change detection.

<b>Redux flow explanation?</b>
UI dispatches action → action goes to reducer → reducer returns new state → store updates → UI re-renders.

<b>Difference between Context API and Redux?</b>
Context API is best for simple state sharing. Redux is better for complex, large-scale applications with middleware support and debugging tools.

<b>What is middleware in Redux?</b>
Middleware is a layer between dispatch and reducer used for logging, async operations, and API handling (e.g., redux-thunk, redux-saga).`,

          text1: `<b>How does React work?</b>
React works by creating a virtual representation of the UI called the Virtual DOM and efficiently updating the real DOM when state or props change.

<b>Step-by-step working of React:</b>
<b>1. Component rendering</b>
React applications are built using components. Each component returns JSX, which describes the UI structure.
<b>2. Virtual DOM creation</b>
When a component renders, React creates a Virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the actual DOM).
<b>3. Initial render</b>
React takes the Virtual DOM and converts it into the real DOM, which is displayed in the browser.
<b>4. State or props change</b>
When state or props of a component change (using useState, props update, etc.), React re-renders the component and creates a new Virtual DOM.
<b>5. Diffing (Reconciliation)</b>
React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called "diffing algorithm".
<b>6. Efficient update</b>
React identifies only the changed parts and updates only those parts in the real DOM instead of reloading the entire page.
<b>Example:</b>
If only a button text changes, React updates only that button, not the whole page.
<b>Key interview points:</b>
- React uses Virtual DOM for performance optimization
- Only changed UI parts are updated (not full page reload)
- Reconciliation is the process of comparing old and new Virtual DOM
- State/props changes trigger re-render
- Makes UI fast and efficient



<b>How to improve React performance?</b>
Use React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, lazy loading, code splitting, avoiding unnecessary state updates, and optimizing rendering of large lists using virtualization.

<b>What is prop drilling?</b>
Prop drilling is passing data through multiple nested components unnecessarily. It can be avoided using Context API or Redux.

<b>What is reconciliation in React?</b>
Reconciliation is the process where React compares virtual DOM with previous version and updates only changed elements in real DOM.

<b>What is lazy loading in React?</b>
Lazy loading loads components only when needed using React.lazy and Suspense, improving initial load performance.`,

          text1: `<b>Difference between display: block, inline, inline-block?</b>
Block elements take full width. Inline elements take only content width. Inline-block behaves like inline but allows width and height.

<b>What is z-index in CSS?</b>
z-index is a CSS property used to control the stacking order of overlapping elements on a webpage. It determines which element appears in front and which appears behind when elements are positioned on top of each other.
Important point:
z-index only works on elements that have a position value other than static (i.e., position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
Higher z-index value means the element will appear on top of elements with lower z-index.
<b>Example:</b>
In the below example, we have two overlapping boxes. The box with higher z-index will appear on top.


<b>What is specificity in CSS?</b>
Specificity determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element.
