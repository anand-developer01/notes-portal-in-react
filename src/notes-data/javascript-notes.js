      note: [

		          text1: `<b>1. Primitive Types</b>
There are 7 primitive types in JavaScript. They are <b>immutable</b>, meaning the value itself cannot be changed (though the variable assigned to it can be reassigned).

<b>Number </b>:	Integers and floating-point numbers. -	let age = 25;
<b>String </b>:	Sequences of characters. -	let name = "Alice";
<b>Boolean </b>:	Logical values: true or false. -	let isTrue = true;
<b>Undefined </b>:	A variable that has been declared but not assigned. -	let x;
<b>Null	</b>: Intentional absence of any object value. -	let y = null;
<b>Symbol </b>:	Unique and immutable identifiers (ES6).	- Symbol('id')
<b>BigInt </b>:	Numbers too large for the standard Number type. - 9007199254740991n

<b>2. Non-Primitive Types (Reference Types)</b>
In JavaScript, there is essentially only one non-primitive type: <b>The Object</b>. Everything else that isn't a primitive—Arrays, Functions, Dates, and Maps—is technically an object under the hood.
Object: { name: "John", age: 30 }
Array: [1, 2, 3]
Function: function sayHi() { ... }
<b>Key Behavior</b>: When you copy a non-primitive, you copy the <b>reference</b> (the memory address), not the actual data.

<b>Memory Location</b>
<b>Primitive Types</b>: These are stored on the <b>Stack</b>. The Stack is a simple, fast data structure that stores the actual value directly in the memory space allocated to the variable.
<b>Non-Primitive Types</b>: The actual data is stored on the <b>Heap</b>, while a "pointer" (reference) to that location is stored on the <b>Stack</b>. The Heap is a larger, more complex memory area for data that needs more space.

<b>Size</b>
<b>Primitive Types</b>: These have a <b>Fixed Size</b>. Because the engine knows exactly how much memory a number or boolean requires, it can allocate that space efficiently on the Stack.
<b>Non-Primitive Types</b>: These have a <b>Dynamic Size</b>. Objects and arrays can grow or shrink as you add or remove properties, so they require the flexible memory of the Heap.

<b>Comparison</b>
<b>Primitive Types</b>: These are <b>Compared by Value</b>. If two variables hold the value 10, they are considered equal because the data inside them is identical.
<b>Non-Primitive Types</b>: These are <b>Compared by Reference</b>. Two objects are only equal if they point to the exact same memory address. Even if two separate objects look identical ({} and {}), they are not equal because they live in different spots in memory.

<b>Mutability</b>
<b>Primitive Types</b>: These are <b>Immutable</b>. You cannot change the value of a primitive once it is created. For example, you cannot change a character inside a string; you must create an entirely new string.
<b>Non-Primitive Types</b>: These are <b>Mutable</b>. You can modify, add, or delete properties within an object or elements within an array without creating a brand-new instance in memory.

<b>Primitives are Immutable</b>: You cannot reach inside a String or Number and change it. If let name = "John", you can't change the "J" to a "P". You can only replace the whole word with a new one.
<b>Objects are Mutable</b>: You can reach inside and change a part of it.

<b>Ex : 3</b>
<b>1. The Memory Address (Referential Identity)</b>
Even though the properties and values are identical, <b>obj1</b> and <b>obj2</b> are two distinct entities.
When you define <b>obj1</b>, JavaScript allocates a space in the <b>Heap</b> (e.g., Address #001).
When you define <b>obj2</b>, JavaScript allocates a new space in the <b>Heap</b> (e.g., Address #002).
The variables <b>obj1</b> and <b>obj2</b> actually hold these memory addresses, not the data itself.

<b>2. The Strict Equality Comparison (===)</b>
The === operator for objects checks for <b>Referential Equality</b>. It asks: "Do these two variables point to the exact same location in memory?"
Address #001 === Address #002 is false.

<b>3. The Loose Equality Comparison (==)</b>
You might expect <b>==</b> to be "smarter" and look inside the object, but in JavaScript, <b>==</b> follows the same logic as <b>===</b> when comparing two objects. It does not perform "structural equality" (checking the keys and values). It still only checks if the references are the same.
Address #001 == Address #002 is false.
`,
					code1: `// --------- primitive -----------
					When you copy a primitive, you copy the value.
					let a = 10;
let b = a; // b gets a brand new copy of 10
b = 20;    // Changing b does NOT change a

// ---------------  Non-Primitive (Objects)  -----------------
let obj1 = { score: 10 };
let obj2 = obj1; // obj2 now points to the SAME memory address as obj1
obj2.score = 99; 
console.log(obj1.score); // 99 (It changed for both!)

// ----------- Ex : 3 --------------
const obj1 = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const obj2 = { name: "John", age: 30 };
console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false
console.log(obj1 == obj2); // false

      note: [
        {
          text1: `JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that JavaScript can do only one thing at a single point in time.
          The JavaScript engine executes a script from the top of the file and works its way down. It creates the execution contexts, and pushes, and pops functions onto and off the call stack in the execution phase.
          If a function takes a long time to execute, you cannot interact with the web browser during the function's execution because the page hangs.
          A function that takes a long time to complete is called a blocking function. Technically, a blocking function blocks all the interactions on the webpage, such as mouse clicks.
          An example of a blocking function is a function that calls an API from a remote server.
          
          The following example uses a big loop to simulate a blocking function:`,
          code1: `      function task(message) {
            // emulate time consuming task
            let n = 10000000000;
            while (n > 0){
                n--;
            }
            console.log(message);
        }
        
        console.log('Start script...');
        task('Call an API');
        console.log('Done!');`,
        },

          text1: ``,

          img: `../assets/images/javascript/EventLoop2.gif`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Event Loop</b>:
The event loop is like a diligent coordinator, making sure everything runs smoothly. <u>It watches over the <b>call stack</b> and <b>task queues (event queue)</b></u>. If the call stack is empty, it checks the task queues and moves tasks to the call stack for execution. This helps keep your applications responsive and free from freezing, even when handling asynchronous operations like <b>setTimeout, fetch</b>, or <b>promises</b>.
When you have a setTimeOut and a Delay, It's not the dalay until it gets moved onto the call stack. no it's the delay until it gets moved to the task queue 

<b>Event Loop</b>: — The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the event queue. When the call stack is empty (i.e., no code is executing), the event loop takes the first event from the event queue and pushes its corresponding callback function onto the call stack. This process is known as “popping an event off the queue.”

The <b>Event Loop</b> is a mechanism that <b>continuously checks the call stack and the task queue</b>, and <b>executes queued tasks (callbacks) when the call stack is empty</b>.

<b>Event Loop</b>
The Event Loop is like a manager who keeps an eye on the call stack and the Callback Queue. Here's how it works:
1) The Event Loop looks at the call stack to see if it's empty.
2) If the stack is empty, it takes the first task from the Callback Queue and puts it on the stack.
3) The task runs and is then removed from the stack.
4) This process repeats.

<b>Web APIs</b>
JavaScript in browsers provides Web APIs for handling tasks like setTimeout, fetch, and DOM events. These APIs run in the background and, when tasks are completed, their callbacks are added to the Callback Queue.

<b>Callback Queue</b>
The Callback Queue (also known as the <b>Task Queue</b>) is where asynchronous callbacks from Web APIs wait to be executed.
When the call stack is empty, the Event Loop picks the first task from the Callback Queue and puts it on the call stack for execution.

<b>Call Stack</b>:
Imagine the call stack as a list where JavaScript keeps track of function calls. When you call a function, it gets added to the top of this list. Once the function finishes, it's removed. If a function calls another function, the new one gets added to the top, creating a stacking effect.
The call stack is a simple data structure that keeps track of function calls. Think of it as a pile of books where you can only add or remove the book on top.

<b>Microtask Queue</b>:
Microtasks are usually promises and mutation observers. When a promise resolves, its .then() callback goes to the microtask queue. Microtasks are the top priority. After finishing a task in the call stack, the event loop first handles all tasks in the microtask queue before moving to the macrotask queue, ensuring crucial operations are done quickly.

<b>Macrotask Queue</b>:
Macrotasks include timers (setTimeout, setInterval), I/O operations, and other events. These tasks go into the macrotask queue. The event loop processes them one by one in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, but only after the call stack and microtask queue are empty.

<b>Microtasks and Macrotasks</b>
Tasks in JavaScript are divided into two categories: macrotasks and microtasks.
<b>Macrotasks</b>: These include <u>setTimeout, setInterval</u>, and I/O operations. They are placed in the Callback Queue.
<b>Microtasks</b>: These include <u>Promise</u> callbacks and <u>MutationObserver</u>. They are placed in the Microtask Queue.

          code1: ``
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, we have a big while loop inside the task() function that emulates a time-consuming task. The task() function is a blocking function.
      
          The script hangs for a few seconds (depending on how fast the computer is) and issues the following output:
          
          Start script...
          Download a file.
          Done!
          To execute the script, the JavaScript engine places the first call console.log() on top of the call stack and executes it. Then, it places the task() function on top of the call stack and executes the function.
          
          However, it'll take a while to complete the task() function. Therefore, you'll see the message 'Download a file.' a little time later. After the task() function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack.
          
          Finally, the JavaScript engine places the last call to the console.log('Done!') function and executes it, which will be very fast.
    
          Callbacks to the rescue
          To prevent a blocking function from blocking other activities, you typically put it in a callback function for execution later. For example:`,
          code1: `console.log('Start script...');
      
          setTimeout(() => {
              task('Download a file.');
          }, 1000);
          
          console.log('Done!');`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, you'll see the message 'Start script...' and 'Done!' immediately. And after that, you'll see the message 'Download a file'.
      
          Here's the output:
          
          Start script...
          Done!
          Download a file.
          As mentioned earlier, the JavaScript engine can do only one thing at a time. However, it's more precise to say that the JavaScript runtime can do one thing at a time.
          
          The web browser also has other components, not just the JavaScript engine.
          
          When you call the setTimeout() function, make a fetch request, or click a button, the web browser can do these activities concurrently and asynchronously.
          
          The setTimeout(), fetch requests and DOM events are parts of the Web APIs of the web browser.
          
          In our example, when calling the setTimeout() function, the JavaScript engine places it on the call stack, and the Web API creates a timer that expires in 1 second.
          
          Then JavaScript engine places the task() function into a queue called a callback queue or a task queue:
          
          The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.
          
          If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen:
          `,
          code1: `See another example:
      
          console.log('Hi!');
          
          setTimeout(() => {
              console.log('Execute immediately.');
          }, 0);
          
          console.log('Bye!');`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, the timeout is 0 seconds, so the message 'Execute immediately.' should appear before the message 'Bye!'. However, it doesn't work like that.
      
          The JavaScript engine places the following function call on the callback queue and executes it when the call stack is empty. In other words, the JavaScript engine executes it after the 
          
          console.log('Bye!').
          console.log('Execute immediately.');
          
          Here's the output:
            <span style="color:red">
            Hi!
            Bye!
            Execute immediately.
            </span>

      title: "hoisting",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

          hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope - all before code execution. In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.
    
          In JavaScript, "hoisting" refers to the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared in your code.
    
          Hoisting is a concept or behavior in JavaScript where the declaration of a function, variable, or class goes to the top of the scope they were defined in.
          
          Introduction to the JavaScript hoisting
    When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates the global execution context. The global execution context has two phases:
    
    <b>1) Creation </b>
    <b>2) Execution </b>
    During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of your code. This is known as hoisting in JavaScript.
    
    <b>Variable hoisting</b>
    Variable hoisting means the JavaScript engine moves the variable declarations to the top of the script. For example, the following example declares the counter variable and initialize its value to 1:`,
          code1: `console.log(counter); // 👉 undefined
          var counter = 1;`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, we reference the counter variable before the declaration.
          However, the first line of code doesn't cause an error. The reason is that the JavaScript engine moves the variable declaration to the top of the script.
          Technically, the code looks like the following in the execution phase:`,
          code1: `var counter;
          console.log(counter); // 👉 undefined
          counter = 1;`
        },
        {
          text1: `During the creation phase of the global execution context, the JavaScript engine places the variable counter in the memory and initializes its value to undefined.
          The let keyword
The following declares the variable counter with the let keyword:`,
          code1: `console.log(counter);
          let counter = 1;
          
          The JavaScript issues the following error:
          
          // "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'counter' before initialization
          // The error message explains that the counter variable is already in the heap memory. However, it hasn't been initialized.
          `
        },
        {
          text1: `Behind the scenes, the JavaScript engine hoists the variable declarations that use the let keyword. However, it doesn't initialize the let variables.

          Notice that if you access a variable that doesn't exist, the JavaScript will throw a different error:`,
          code1: `
          console.log(alien);
          let counter = 1;

          // Here is the error:
          // ReferenceError: alien is not defined
          `
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Function hoisting</b>
          Like variables, the JavaScript engine also hoists the function declarations. This means that the JavaScript engine also moves the function declarations to the top of the script. For example:`,
          code1: `let x = 20,
          y = 10;
        
        let result = add(x, y); 
        console.log(result); // 👉 30
        
        function add(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }
        
        Output: 30

        // In this example, we called the add() function before defining it. The above code is equivalent to the following:
        
        function add(a, b){
            return a + b;
        }
        
        let x = 20,
            y = 10;
        
        let result = add(x,y);

        {
          text1: `During the creation phase of the execution context, the JavaScript engine places the add() function declaration in the heap memory. To be precise, the JavaScript engine creates an object of the Function type and a function reference add that refers to the function object.
          
          Function expressions
          The following example changes the add from a regular function to a function expression:`,
          code1: `let x = 20,
          y = 10;
      
      let result = add(x,y); // ❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined

          Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
          
          During the creation phase of the global execution context, the JavaScript engine creates the add variable in the memory and initializes its value to undefined.
          
          When executing the following code, the add is undefined, hence, it isn't a function:
          
          let result = add(x,y);
          
          The add variable is assigned to an anonymous function only during the execution phase of the global execution context.
          
          Arrow functions
          The following example changes the add function expression to the arrow function:
          `,
          code1: `let x = 20,
          y = 10;
      
      let result = add(x,y); // ❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
      console.log(result);
      
      let add = (x, y) => x + y; `

          Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
          
          Similar to the functions expressions, arrow functions are not hoisted.

    var x = 10;
    console.log(x); // ✅ Accessible here
}
console.log(x); // ❌ Error: x is not defined (because it's inside the function)
Variables declared with <b>var</b> inside a function are <b>not accessible outside that function.</b>

<b>ii). Global Scope</b>
If var is declared <b>outside any function</b>, it becomes a <b>global variable</b> attached to the <b>window object</b> (in browsers).

<b>iii). No Block Scope (Function-Scoped Instead)</b>
Unlike let and const, <b>var</b> does <b>not respect block scope</b> ({} blocks like if, for, etc.).
if (true) {
    var z = 30;
}
console.log(z); // ✅ Accessible outside the if block (unexpected behavior)
Even though <b>z</b> is declared inside the <b>if</b> block, it <b>leaks</b> out and is accessible outside.

<b>2) How to redeclare and reassign variables declared with, var</b>
Variables declared with var can be redeclared and reassigned
var number = 50
You have the <b>var</b> keyword, the name of the variable <b>number</b>, and an initial value <b>50</b>. If an initial value is not provided, the default value will be <b>undefined</b>:

The <b>var</b> keyword allows for redeclaration.
The <b>var</b> keyword also allows for reassignment. 

<b>3) How to hoist variables declared with var</b>
Variables declared with <b>var</b> are hoisted to the top of their global or local scope, which makes them accessible before the line they are declared.
but their <b>value is not initialized </b> until the declaration line is reached.

<b>Ex : 5 local scope</b>
In the <b>print</b> function, <b>number</b> has a local scope. Due to hoisting, we can access the <b>number</b> variable before the line of declaration.
As we see in <b>square1</b>, we assign <b>number * number</b>. Since <u>number</u> is hoisted with a default value of <b>undefined</b>, <u>square1</u> will be <b>undefined * undefined</b> which results in <b>NaN</b>.
After the line of declaration with an initial value is executed, <u>number</u> will have a value of <b>50</b>. So in <u>square2</u>, <b>number * number</b> will be <b>50 * 50</b> which results in <b>2500</b>.

Another is the <b>Local Scope</b>, variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the local scope and it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped.

<b>Function Scope</b>: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function.
<b>Block Scope</b>: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.
`,
          code1: `// ---------- var Ex : 1 ---------
          // The "number" variable has a global scope – it's declared outside functions in the global space – so you can access it everywhere (inside and outside functions).
          // Any attempt to access the variable outside the function where it was declared will result in a "variable is not defined"  reference error.
                  var number = 50
        function print() {
            var square = number * number;
            var localSC = 1000;
            console.log(square)
        }
        console.log(number) // 50
        console.log(localSC) // index.html:21 Uncaught ReferenceError: localSC is not defined
        print() // 2500
        

        //---------- If an initial value is not provided, the default value will be undefined: Ex : 2 ------
        var number
console.log(number)
// undefined

//------------- The var keyword allows for redeclaration. Ex : 3 -----------
As you can see, we have redeclared the variable number using the var keyword and an initial value of 100.
var number = 50
console.log(number) // 50

var number = 100
console.log(number) // 100


//------------ Ex : 4
console.log(number) // undefined
var number = 50
console.log(number) // 50

// The number variable here has a global scope. Since it is declared with var, the variable is hoisted. This means that we can access the variable before the line where it was declared without errors.
// But the variable is hoisted with a default value of "undefined". So that's the value returned from the variable (until the line where the variable is declared with an initial value gets executed).


//------------ local scope Ex : 5 ----------
        function print() {
            var square1 = number * number
            console.log(square1)

            var number = 50

            var square2 = number * number
            console.log(square2)
        }

        print()
        // NaN

          text1: `<b><span class="sub-heading">Declare Variables with <code>let</code> in JavaScript</span></b>
          <b>1) The scope of variables declared with let</b>
Variables declared with <u>let</u> can have a <b>global, local</b>, or <b>block scope</b>. Block scope is for variables declared in a block. A block in JavaScript involves opening and closing curly braces:
{
  // a block
}

You can find blocks in <u>if, loop, switch</u>, and a couple of other statements. Any variables declared in such blocks with the <u>let</u> keyword will have a block scope. Also, you can't access these variables outside the block.

In <b>Ex : 1</b> example, we have a global scope variable <b>number</b> and a local scope variable <b>square</b>. There's also block scope variable <b>anotherLargerNumber</b> because it is declared with <b>let</b> in a block.

<b>largerNumber</b>, on the other hand - though declared in a block - does not have a block scope because it is declared with <b>var</b>. So <b>largerNumber</b> has a local scope as it is declared in the function <b>print</b>.

We can access <b>number</b> everywhere. We can only access <b>square</b> and <b>largerNumber</b> in the function because they have local scope. But accessing <b>anotherLargerNumber</b> outside the block throws an <b>anotherLargerNumber</b> is not defined error.


<b>2) How to redeclare and reassign variables declared with let</b>
Just like var, variables declared with let can be reassigned to other values, but they cannot be redeclared. 

<b>3) How to hoist variables declared with let</b>
Variables declared with <b>let</b> are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope, but their hoisting is a little different from the one with <b>var</b>.
<b>var</b> variables are hoisted with a default value of <b>undefined</b>, which makes them accessible before their line of declaration (as we've seen above).
But, <b>let</b> variables are hoisted without a default initialization. So when you try to access such variables, instead of getting <b>undefined</b>, or <b>variable is not defined error</b>, you get <b>cannot access variable before initialization</b>. Let's see an example:
`,
          code1: `//--------- let Ex : 1 ---------
          let number = 50
function print() {
  let square = number * number
  if (number < 60) {
    var largerNumber = 80
    let anotherLargerNumber = 100

    console.log(square)
  }
  console.log(largerNumber)
  console.log(anotherLargerNumber)
}

print()
// 2500
// 80
// ReferenceError: anotherLargerNumber is not defined


//------------ Ex : 2 -----------
let number = 50
console.log(number) // 50
number = 100
console.log(number) // 100
// Here, we reassigned another value 100 after the initial declaration of 50.


//------------ Ex : 3 -----------
// But redeclaring a variable with let will throw an error:
let number = 50
let number = 100 // SyntaxError: Identifier 'number' has already been declared
// You see we get a syntax error: Identifier 'number' has already been declared.


//------------ Ex : 4 ----------
// cannot access variable before initialization
console.log(number)
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'number' before initialization
let number = 50
// Here, we have a global variable, "number" declared with "let". By trying to access this variable before the line of declaration, we get "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'number' before initialization".
`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b><span class="sub-heading">How to Declare Variables with <code>const</code> in JavaScript</span></b>
<b> 1) The scope of variables declared with const </b>
Variables declared with <u>const</u> are similar to <u>let</u> in regards to <u>scope</u>. Such variables can have a <b>global, local</b>, or <b>block</b> scope.

In Ex : 1 example, but I've replaced <u>let</u> with <u>const</u>. As you can see here, the <u>number</u> variable has a global scope, <u>square</u> has a local scope (declared in the <u>print</u> function), and <u>anotherLargeNumber</u> has a block scope (declared with <u>const</u>).
There's also <u>largeNumber</u>, declared in a block. But because it is with <u>var</u>, the variable only has a local scope. Therefore, it can be accessed outside the block.
Because <u>anotherLargeNumber</u> has a block scope, accessing it outside the block throws an <b>anotherLargerNumber is not defined</b>.

<b> 2) How to redeclare and reassign variables declared with const</b>
In this regard, <u>const</u> is different from <u>var</u> and <u>let</u>. <u>const</u> is used for declaring <b>constant</b> variables - which are variables with values that cannot be changed. So such variables cannot be redeclared, and neither can they be reassigned to other values. Attempting such would throw an error.

<b> 3) How to hoist variables declared with const</b>
Variables declared with <b>const</b>, just like <b>let</b>, are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope - but without a default initialization.

<b>var</b> variables, as you've seen earlier, are hoisted with a default value of <b>undefined</b> so they can be accessed before declaration without errors. Accessing a variable declared with <b>const</b> before the line of declaration will throw a <b>cannot access variable before initialization</b> error.

Here, <u>number</u> is a globally scoped variable declared with <u>const</u>. By trying to access this variable before the line of declaration, we get <b>ReferenceError: Cannot access 'number' before initialization</b>. The same will occur if it was a locally scoped variable.
`,
          code1: `//---------------- Ex : 1 --------------
          const number = 50

Running this code produces this <b>error: ReferenceError: number2 is not defined</b>

<b>Ex : 1 </b> error says <b>ReferenceError: Cannot access 'number' before initialization</b> 
<b>Ex : 2 </b> error says <b>ReferenceError: number2 is not defined.</b>

This means that JavaScript <u>knows</u> about the <b>number</b>(<b>Ex : 1 </b>) variable. How does it know? Because <b>number</b> is hoisted to the top of the global scope.

Well, this clarifies the difference between the hoisting behavior with <u>var</u> and <u>let/const</u>.
Variables declared with <u>let</u> or <u>const</u> are <b>hoisted WITHOUT a default initialization</b>. So accessing them before the line they were declared throws <b>ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization</b>.
But variables declared with <u>var</u> are <b>hoisted WITH a default initialization of undefined</b>. So accessing them before the line they were declared returns <u>undefined</u>.

<b>Temporal Dead Zone</b>
There's a name for the period during execution where <u>let/const</u> variables are hoisted but not accessible: it's called the <u>Temporal Dead Zone.</u>

The <b>Temporal Dead Zone</b> refers to the period between the entering of a scope and the actual declaration of a variable using <b>let</b> or <b>const</b>. During this period, the variable is in an "uninitialized" state and accessing it will result in a <span style="color:red;">ReferenceError</span>.

A <b>temporal dead zone (TDZ)</b> is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.

The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is a specific period in the execution of JavaScript code where variables declared with let and const exist but cannot be accessed or assigned any value. During this phase, accessing or using the variable will result in a ReferenceError.

      title: "Variable Shadowing",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Variable Shadowing in JavaScript occurs when the inner variable hides or overrides the outer variable within the local scope. In this situation, the outer variable cannot be accessed within the inner scope, only the inner variable is used in that scope.

-> Variable Shadowing occurs when we declare the same name for the variable in the inner and outer scope.
-> The inner variable will hide or override the outer variable.
-> The outer variable will become inaccessible until the code exists in the inner scope.
<b>Key Points of Variable Shadowing:</b>
The inner variable hides or "shadows" the outer variable.
The inner variable only exists in the scope where it is defined (like inside a function or block).
The outer variable remains accessible outside the scope of the inner variable.

Imagine that you created two variables with exactly the same name but different values. The difference us that they are located in different scopes. One of them is located in the global scope while the other is in the function.

Ex : 1
When we declare a variable in the function scope while having a variable with the exact same name in the outer scope (global scope in this case), the value assigned in the inner scope is the value that will be stored in the memory. The inner scope usually is supposed to have access to the outer scope however when we declare variables with the same name, things change.

This is called shadowing or variable shadowing in JavaScript. The inner scope variable shadowed the outer scope variable.

But why is the result value apple in the second console log?
Because the variable will be gone from the memory when the function ends and it doesn't go outside of it. This happens due to the scope hierarchy in JavaScript. The priority of scopes goes from inner-most to outer-most scope. In other words, the inner scope has more priority than the outer scope. That is why, the variables inside the function are prioritized and then when the function ends, they are gone from the memory.

<b>Shadowing with let and const</b>
When we declare the variable with the let or const, the variable only exists inside the block (like an if statement or a loop). If we use the same name for a variable inside the block, it will hide the one outside the block. This is different from var, which is only limited to the function. Ex : 2


As you see, things change here. The var keyword value changed because it is not block-scoped and it's not scoped. As a result, no variable shadowing happens here.
`,
          code1: `let fruit = "apple"; // Outer scope variable

function chooseFruit(){
    let fruit = "orange"; // Inner scope variable, shadows the outer fruit

}

chooseFruit(); // Function call
console.log(fruit); // Outputs the outer fruit value "apple"

let n = 10;

If you create a variable in an outer scope with the let keyword and another variable with the var keyword in a block scope but with the same name, it will throw an error. This is called illegal shadowing.
This happens because let and var both technically have the same scope meaning that the variable name fruit already exists there. The variable declared with the var in the block scope is not trapped in the block scope and is accessible to the parent, the function.

Shadowing the variables declared with let and const in same scope is illegal.
let a = 10;
let a = 5;

let a = 10;

This context sets the stage for the entire code execution process and plays a pivotal role in managing global variables and functions.
    
          There are two phases of JavaScript execution context:
    
          <b>Creation phase:</b> In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. It determines the values of variables and functions and sets up the scope chain for the execution context.
          
          <b>Execution phase:</b> In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. It processes any statements or expressions in the script and evaluates any function calls.

          Behind the scenes, JavaScript does many things. in this tutorial, you will focus on execution contexts.
          When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates execution contexts.
          Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.
    
          <b>The creation phase:</b>
    
          When the JavaScript engine executes a script for the first time, it creates the global execution context. During this phase, the JavaScript engine performs the following tasks:
    
          > Create the global object i.e., <b>window</b> in the web browser or <b>global</b> in Node.js.
          > Create the <b>this</b> object and bind it to the global object.
          > Set up a memory heap for storing variables and function references.
          > Store the function declarations in the memory heap and variables within the global execution context with the initial values as <b>undefined</b>.
    
          When the JavaScript engine executes the code example above, it does the following in the creation phase:
    
          > First, store the variables <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> and function declaration timesTen() in the global execution context.
          > Second, initialize the variables <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> to <b>undefined</b>.
    
          <span style="background:yellow; width:300px; padding:10px;" class="text-center d-flex flex-column">
          <b>Global Execution Context</b> </br>Creation Phase (Web Browser)
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">Global Object : Window</span>
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">this : window</span>
          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">x : undefined</span>

          <span style="background:#8989ac; padding:10px; margin:3px;">y : undefined</span>
          </span>

          After the creation phase, the global execution context moves to the execution phase.
    
          <b>The execution phase:</b>
    
          During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.

          For each function call, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context.
    
          The function execution context is similar to the global execution context. But instead of creating the global object, the JavaScript engine creates the <b>arguments</b> object that is a reference to all the parameters of the function:

          During the execution phase of the function execution context, the JavaScript engine assigns <b>10</b> to the parameter <b>a</b> and returns the result (100) to the global execution context:

          <b>scope</b> refers to the context or environment in which a variable is declared and accessible. It determines where a variable or function can be referenced or used within the code. Scope is important because it helps prevent naming conflicts and determines the lifecycle and visibility of variables.
          JavaScript refers to the context or environment in which variables are declared and can be accessed.
          
          Scope determines the visibility and accessibility of a variable. JavaScript has Four scopes:
          1) The global scope
          2) Local scope
          3) Block scope (started from ES6)

          <b>The global scope</b>:
          In JavaScript, global scope is the widest scope available. Variables declared in global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code, whether it's inside functions, conditional statements, loops, or other blocks of code.
You can think of global scope as the "public square" of your program, where everyone can see and access what's going on.
Variables declared outside of any function or block (<u>using var, let, or const</u>) are in the global scope.
Global variables can be accessed anywhere in the code, including inside functions or blocks.

          When the JavaScript engine executes a script, it creates a global execution context.
          Also, it also assigns variables that you declare outside of functions to the global execution context. These variables are in the global scope. They are also known as global variables.

          Accessing global variables is straightforward. You can use them within functions or any part of your code without any special effort
    
          See the following example:
          var message = 'Hi';
          
          The variable message is <b>global-scoped</b>. It can be accessible everywhere in the script.

          The variables that you declare inside a function are local to the function. They are called local variables. When the JavaScript engine executes the say() function, it creates a function execution context. The variable message declared inside the say() function is bound to the function execution context of the function, not the global execution context.

In this example, we reference the variable <b>message</b> inside the <b>say()</b> function. Behind the scenes, JavaScript performs the following:
          Look up the variable <b>message</b> in the current context (function execution context) of the <b>say()</b> function. It cannot find any.
          Find the variable <b>message</b> in the outer execution context which is the global execution context. It finds the variable <b>message</b>.
          The way that JavaScript resolves a variable is by looking at it in its current scope, if it cannot find the variable, it goes up to the outer scope, which is called the scope chain.

          This issue is known as the leaks of the global variables.
    
          Under the hood, the JavaScript engine first looks up the <b>counter</b> variable in the local scope of the <b>getCounter()</b> function. Because there is no <b>var, let, or const</b> keyword, the <b>counter</b> variable is not available in the local scope. It hasn't been created.
    
          Then, the JavaScript engine follows the scope chain and looks up the <b>counter</b> variable in the global scope. The global scope also doesn't have the <b>counter</b> variable, so the JavaScript engine creates the <b>counter</b> variable in the global scope.

          text1: `The JavaScript execution contexts (Global execution context and function execution context) are executed via the JavaScript engine. In order to manage these execution contexts, the JS engine uses the call stack. So, the JS call stack is a data structure that keeps track information of the functions being called and executed. Thus, if the user invokes a function for execution, the specified function gets pushed/added in the call stack, and when the user returns from a function, it means the function is popped out from the call stack. Thus, call stack is a normal stack data structure that follows the stack order principal, i.e., <b>LIFO (Last In First Out)</b>.

          Introduction to JavaScript Call Stack
          A call stack is a way for the JavaScript engine to keep track of its place in code that calls multiple functions. It has the information on what function is currently being run and what functions are invoked from within that function…

          <b>Call Stack</b>: — The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the currently executing code. It maintains a record of function calls and their respective contexts (local variables, parameters).

          You've probably already heard that JavaScript is single-threaded. But what does this mean?
<b>JavaScript can do one single thing at a time</b> because it has only one call stack.
The call stack is a mechanism that helps the JavaScript interpreter to <b>keep track of the functions that a script calls</b>.
Every time a script or function <b>calls</b> a function, it's <b>added to the top of the call stack</b>. Every time the function <b>exits</b>, the interpreter <b>removes it from the call stack</b>.
A function either exits through a return statement or by reaching the end of the scope.
    
          Also, the JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts:
          <b>The global execution context</b>
          <b>Function execution contexts</b>
          The call stack works based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.
          When you execute a script, the JavaScript engine creates a global execution context and pushes it on top of the call stack.
          Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a function execution context for the function, pushes it on top of the call stack, and starts executing the function.
          If a function calls another function, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context for the function being called and pushes it on top of the call stack.
          When the current function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack and resumes the execution where it left off.
          The script will stop when the call stack is empty.
    
          <b>JavaScript call stack example</b>
          Let's start with the following example:`,
          code1: `
function multiply(a, b){
    console.log("multiply")
   return a * b; 
}

function square(n){
    console.log("square")
    return multiply(n,n)
}

function printSquare(n){
    console.log("printSquare")
    let squared = square(n)
    return squared
}

console.log(printSquare(4))

          The global execution context enters the creation phase and moves to the execution phase.
    
          The JavaScript engine executes the call to the <b>average(10, 20)</b> function and creates a function execution context for the <b>average()</b> function and pushes it on top of the call stack:
    
          The JavaScript engine starts executing the <b>average()</b> since because the <b>average()</b> function is on the top of the call stack.
    
          The <b>average()</b> function calls <b>add()</b> function. At this point, the JavaScript engine creates another function execution context for the <b>add()</b> function and places it on the top of the call stack:
    
          JavaScript engine executes the <b>add()</b> function and pops it off the call stack:
    
          At this point, the <b>average()</b> function is on the top of the call stack, the JavaScript engine executes and pops it off the call stack.
    
          Now, the call stack is empty so the script stops executing:
    
          The following picture illustrates the overall status of the Call Stack in all steps:
          
          <b>Stack Overflow</b>
The call stack has a fixed size, depending on the implementation of the host environment, either the web browser or Node.js.

If the number of execution contexts exceeds the size of the stack, a stack overflow error will occur.

For example, when you execute a recursive function that has no exit condition, the JavaScript engine will issue a stack overflow error:
`,
          code1: `function add(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        
        function average(a, b) {
            return add(a, b) / 2;
        }
        
        let x = average(10, 20);
          
          function fn() {
            fn();
        }
        
        fn(); // stack overflow`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Asynchronous JavaScript</b>
          JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that the JavaScript engine has only one call stack. Therefore, it only can do one thing at a time.
          
          When executing a script, the JavaScript engine executes code from top to bottom, line by line. In other words, it is synchronous.
          
          Asynchronous means the JavaScript engine can execute other tasks while waiting for another task to be completed. For example, the JavaScript engine can:
          
          Request for data from a remote server.
          Display a spinner
          When the data is available, display it on the webpage.
          To do this, the JavaScript engine uses an event loop, which will be covered in the following tutorial.
          
          <b>Summary</b>
          JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts.
          The call stack uses the stack data structure that works based on the LIFO (last-in-first-out) principle.

          Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables
          scope in JavaScript refers to the context or environment in which variables are declared and can be accessed.
          Scope of variables refers to the accessibility of a particular variable within the program.
          <b>Scope</b> refers to the area where an item (such as a function or variable) is visible and accessible to other code.


          In lexical scope, the scope of a variable is defined by where it is written or declared in the source code, rather than by where the function is called. Essentially, lexical scope refers to the context in which the code is written, and this context determines how variables are accessed during the program's execution.

          <b>Types of Scope in JavaScript</b>:
There are different types of scope, and understanding them is crucial to avoiding issues like accidental variable overwriting, unintended side effects, and understanding closures.
    => Global Scope
    => Function Scope
    => Block Scope
    => Lexical Scope (Closures)

    <b>lexical</b> is term hierarchy or in a sequence
          A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not be accessible outside that function.

          function parentFun(){
            var b=10;
            sub();
            function sub(){
              console.log(b)
            }
          }
            Here sub() function lexically setting inside main() function 
            Here sub() function lexically inside main() function that means lexical in order or hierarchy
            
                        The term lexical refers to the structure or arrangement of words or symbols in a language. In programming, especially in the context of lexical scope, it refers to the physical location of code elements (such as variables, functions, and blocks) in the source code itself.

            Here sub() function physically inside main() function
            main() function lexically inside global scope


           <b> Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Execution Flow</b>:
<b>1. Global Execution Context</b>:
Before parentFun() is called, JavaScript starts in the global execution context.
    <b>Global context</b>:
        parentFun is declared and is available to be called in the global scope.
        The JavaScript engine is ready to execute parentFun() when invoked.

<b>2. Execution Context for parentFun()</b>:
When parentFun() is called, a new execution context is created for parentFun. The steps in this context are as follows:
    <b>Creation Phase (for parentFun)</b>:
        The variable b is hoisted to the top of the parentFun() execution context, but its value is initially set to undefined.
        The function sub is hoisted, so it is available to be invoked throughout the entire scope of parentFun().
   <b> Execution Phase (for parentFun)</b>:
        The variable b is set to 10 during the execution phase, so b = 10 is executed.
        sub() is called. At this point, the lexical environment of parentFun() is still active, so sub() can access variables from the parentFun() scope, including b.

<b>3. Execution Context for sub()</b>:
When sub() is invoked, a new execution context is created for sub. This context has the following behavior:
    <b>Creation Phase (for sub)</b>:
        There are no variables declared inside sub(), so the variable environment for sub() is empty.
        The scope chain for sub() includes</b>:
            sub()'s own scope (empty in this case).
            The lexical scope of parentFun(), which has access to b.
            The global scope.
    <b>Execution Phase (for sub)</b>:
        The console.log(b) statement inside sub() is executed. It refers to b from the lexical scope of parentFun(), where b was set to 10.
        Since sub() forms a closure over its lexical environment, it has access to b even though parentFun() has finished execution.
        <b>Closure in Action</b>:
        The closure in this case is the function sub(), which "remembers" and has access to the variable b from its lexical environment (the parentFun() function) even after parentFun() finishes executing.

<b>4. Returning to parentFun()</b>:
After sub() finishes executing and logging b, its execution context is popped off the stack and the program returns to parentFun(). Since parentFun() has no further code to execute, its execution context is also popped off the stack.

Finally, the program finishes executing and returns to the global context.

          (or)
  Lexical Scoping: A function scope's ability to access variables from the parent scope is known as lexical scope.
          (or)
  the inner functions have access to the variables and other resources of their parent scope.
  
  <b>Lexical scoping in JavaScript</b>
JavaScript uses lexical scoping to resolve the variable names when a function is created inside another function. It determines the function's parent scope by looking at where the function was created instead of where it was invoked.

  -The global scope is always the last scope of any JavaScript scope chain. In other words, the global scope is where all searches will end.
  -An inner (child) scope has access to its parent (outer) scope, but an outer scope does not have access to its child scope.
  
  Note:
  Variables created without a declaration keyword (var, let, or const) are always global, even if they are created inside a function.`,
          code1: `var a = 10;  // Global variable 'a' is declared

var func = function () {  // 'func' is a function declared in the global scope
  var b = 20;  // 'b' is declared inside 'func', so it's scoped to 'func'
  
  console.log("a and b are accessible (outer):", a, b);  // 'a' from global scope and 'b' from 'func' scope

  var innerFunc = function () {  // 'innerFunc' is declared inside 'func'
    var c = 30;  // 'c' is declared inside 'innerFunc', so it's scoped to 'innerFunc'
    
    console.log("a, b, and c are accessible (inner):", a, b, c);  // 'a' from global, 'b' from 'func', 'c' from 'innerFunc'
  }

  innerFunc();  // Calls 'innerFunc', which logs all three variables
  return;
}

func();  // Calls 'func', which also calls 'innerFunc' inside it

console.log("only a is accessible (global):", a);  // Only 'a' is accessible here in the global scope

        {
          text1: `Strict mode in JavaScript is a feature that enforces stricter parsing and error handling. It prevents unsafe actions like using undeclared variables, duplicate parameters, and modifies <b>this</b> behavior to be safer. It is enabled using "use strict".
          
          <b>🔹 Why Strict Mode?</b>
It helps you write <b>cleaner, safer, and more optimized code</b> by catching errors early.

<b>What it does</b>
1. Prevents accidental global variables
"use strict";
x = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError — without strict mode, this silently creates a global (Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined)

<b>2. Disallows duplicate parameter names</b>
function add(a, a) { ... }       // ✅ allowed normally
"use strict";
function add(a, a) { ... }       // ❌ SyntaxError

<b>3. Makes <i style="color:#1111aa">this</i> undefined in regular functions (instead of defaulting to the global object)</b>
"use strict";
function greet() { console.log(this); }
greet(); // undefined — not \`window\`

<b>4. Throws on assignments to read-only properties</b>
"use strict";
const obj = Object.freeze({ x: 1 });
obj.x = 2; // ❌ TypeError — silently fails without strict mode

<b>5. Disallows <i style="color:#1111aa">with</i> statements</b>
"use strict";
with (obj) { ... } // ❌ SyntaxError

<b>6. Prevents deleting variables or functions</b>
"use strict";
let x = 5;
delete x; // ❌ SyntaxError

<b>7. Octal literals are forbidden</b>
Octal Literals in JavaScript — Full Example
<b>What is an Octal literal?</b>
An octal number uses base-8 (digits 0–7). In old JavaScript, you could write octal by prefixing a number with <b>0</b>.

Without Strict Mode (Silent / Unexpected Behavior)

"use strict";
let n = 010; // ❌ SyntaxError (octal)
let n = 0o10; // ✅ ES6 octal syntax is fine

<b> Scope: file-level vs. function-level </b>
// Entire file in strict mode
"use strict";
// ...all code here is strict

// Or just one function
function onlyHere() {
  "use strict";
  // strict inside here only
}

<b>Modules are always strict</b>
If you're using ES Modules <b>(import/export)</b>, strict mode is on by default — no need to declare it.

<b>Why use it?</b>
Catches silent bugs early (turns them into errors)
Makes code easier to optimize for JS engines
Prevents use of syntax reserved for future JS features
Generally considered a best practice for all modern JS code



<b>can use "use strict"; in production</b>
Interview-style answer 🎯
Yes, we can use "use strict"; in production. It improves code safety by preventing common mistakes and enabling better error handling. In modern JavaScript, strict mode is enabled by default in ES modules, so we often don’t need to explicitly add it.

<b>Why it’s safe in production</b>
Strict mode is <b>not a debugging feature</b> — it’s part of the JavaScript language. It:
Prevents silent bugs (e.g., undeclared variables)
Makes code more predictable
Helps JavaScript engines optimize better
Avoids risky behaviors
👉 So it actually <b>improves production code quality</b>, not harms it.

<b>✅ Modern JS (ES6+ Modules)</b>
When you use import / export syntax, the file is treated as an ES Module — and strict mode is automatically enabled by the JavaScript spec itself. No need to write "use strict" at all.

✅ If you use bundlers like:
Webpack
Vite
Babel
👉 They usually <b>enable strict mode automatically</b>

<b>🔥 What actually happens in React apps</b>
<b>1. ES Modules → Strict mode by default (MAIN reason)</b>
import React from "react";
👉 The moment you use import/export
👉 The file becomes a module
👉 Strict mode is automatically ON
✅ This is the primary reason, not Babel

<b>2. Babel behavior (secondary / historical)</b>
Babel can add "use strict":
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

<b>👉 But this happens mainly when</b>:
Transpiling to <b>CommonJS</b> (require)
Older setups (Node.js, legacy builds)

👉 In modern setups (Vite, Webpack + ES modules):
Babel may NOT explicitly add it
Because it's already strict due to modules

<b>🔹 So your understanding should be</b>:
❌ Incorrect thinking
Strict mode is ON because Babel adds "use strict"

<b>✅ Correct thinking</b>
Strict mode is ON because the code is running as an ES Module. Babel may add "use strict" in some cases, but it's not required in modern setups.

<b>🎯 Interview-ready answer</b>
In modern React apps, strict mode is enabled automatically because the code uses ES Modules (<b>import/export</b>). While Babel may add <b>"use strict"</b> when transpiling to older formats like CommonJS, it’s not the primary reason in modern setups.
`,
          code1: `// ----------------- ✅ Modern JS (ES6+ Modules) --------------
        // ✅ What’s happening in your example
// math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// main.js
import { add } from "./math.js";

undeclaredVar = 10; // ❌ ReferenceError
console.log(add(2, 3));

// 👉 Both files are ES Modules (because of import/export)
// 🔥 Key Point
// All ES Modules run in strict mode automatically
// So even though you didn’t write:
// "use strict";
// 👉 JavaScript internally treats your code as strict mode.

// 🔹 Why error occurs
// undeclaredVar = 10; 
// In non-strict mode:
// ✔ This would create a global variable silently

// In strict mode:
// ❌ Throws:
// ReferenceError: undeclaredVar is not defined
// 👉 Because strict mode does not allow undeclared variables

          You can use <u>import</u> and <u>export</u> in modules.

          Let's talk about export first. Everything declared inside a module is local to the module, by default. If you want something declared in a module to be public, so that other modules can use it, you must export that feature. There are a few ways to do this. The simplest way is to add the export keyword.

          You can <u>export</u> any top-level <u>function, class, var, let</u>, or <u>const</u>.

          When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.

          The new standard is designed to interoperate with existing CommonJS and AMD modules. So suppose you have a Node project and you've done npm install lodash. Your ES6 code can import individual functions from Lodash:

import {each, map} from "lodash";
each([3, 2, 1], x => console.log(x));


1) Named Exports
2) Default Exports

<b>Named Exports</b>
Named exports allow you to export multiple values (functions, variables, objects, etc.) from a module. You <b>export</b> each item explicitly by using the <u>export</u> keyword, either inline with the declaration or at the end of the module. When importing these values into another module, you must use the exact names used in the export.


<b>Named Exports</b>
<b>Multiple</b> Exports Yes
<b>Import</b> Syntax Curly braces {} required
<b>Renaming</b> Possible during import
<b>Code Readability</b> Easy to identify exported items

<b>Default Export</b>
<b>Multiple</b> Exports No
<b>Import</b> Syntax No curly braces needed
<b>Renaming</b> Import name can be chosen
<b>Code Readability</b> Less obvious, single value

<b>Benefits of ES6 Modules</b>
<b>Encapsulation</b>: Keeps code organized and avoids polluting the global namespace.
<b>Reusability</b>: Easily reuse logic across files.
<b>Lazy Loading</b>: Modules can be loaded on demand for performance optimization.
<b>Improved Readability</b>: Clear dependency management makes code easier to understand.

          A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.

          Higher order functions (HOFs) in JavaScript are functions that can do at least one of the following:
=> Accept other functions as arguments.
=> Return a function as a result.

<b>1. Accepting Functions as Arguments</b>
Higher order functions can accept other functions as arguments. This allows for dynamic behavior, where the behavior of the higher order function can be customized based on the function passed as an argument.

<b>2. Returning Functions</b>
Higher order functions can also return functions. This enables the creation of functions dynamically based on certain conditions or parameters.

<b>3. Abstraction</b>
Higher order functions promote abstraction by encapsulating common patterns or behaviors into reusable functions. This leads to cleaner and more modular code.

          text1: `A pure function is a function that always returns the same output given a specific input.
            
          <b>Definition</b>
Pure functions are building blocks of functional programming. They always yield consistent result and does not manipulate non-local state or have any side effects. There are mainly two requirements of a pure function:

          A pure function does not change any value or state outside of its scope and it doesn't depend on any value outside of its scope. It only depends on the input given to the function and does not produce any side effects.
          
          A pure function in JavaScript is a function that returns the same result(Consistent Results) if the same arguments(input) are passed in the function. Let's see what makes a function pure in detail:
          
          - The return value of the function on the function call should only be dependent on the input function arguments.
          - It should not modify any non-local state. It means the function should not manipulate anything other than the data - stored in the local variables declared within the function.
          The function should not have any side effects, such as reassigning non-local variables, mutating the state of any part of code that is not inside the function, or calling any non-pure functions inside it.
          
          Pure functions are building blocks of functional programming. They always yield consistent result and does not manipulate non-local state or have any side effects. There are mainly two requirements of a pure function:

          <b>Consistent result</b>:--
          - Same result for the same input every time.
          - Result is only dependent on the input arguments. As the function does not perform any operation that requires any variable or data from outside the scope of the function.
          
          <b>No side effects some common side effects</b>:--
          - Making an HTTP request
          - Mutating any data that is not part of the function
          - Printing to a screen or console
          - DOM Query/Manipulation
          - Using Math.random()
          - Getting the current time
          
          <b>1. Better Readability</b>
Pure functions <b>increase the readability</b> of the javascript code because of its simplicity. A pure function always generates a consistent result and it does not mutate any non-local state. All these features of a pure function make it easier to read and understand the code.

<b>2. Testable</b>
It's <b>easier to perform unit testing on a pure function</b> than on an impure function. A pure function result only depends upon its input arguments hence the whole function can be treated as an independent entity. So we can just take that function and test it with some standard input values whose output is known. And we can compare the output we get from the pure function with the expected output to perform the testing.

<b>3. Better Performance</b>
Pure functions can be <b>memoized</b> and this makes your application faster. Memoization is an optimization technique that makes your code more efficient and hence quicker. In memorization, the computational result is stored in the cache once and can be retrieved later when it is needed again instead of computing it again.
          
          <b>Impure Function in Javascript</b>
An impure function <b>gives inconsistent results (different results for the same input values)</b> and can have one or more of one side effects that we discussed earlier in the article. So impure functions in javascript are functions that can mutate non-local states and the result they return might not only be dependent on its input arguments.
`,
          code1: `        const highpass = (cutoff, value) => value >= cutoff;
// The same input values will always map to the same output value:
console.log(highpass(5, 5)); // => true
console.log(highpass(5, 5)); // => true
console.log(highpass(5, 5)); // => true

// Many input values may map to the same output value:
console.log(highpass(5, 123)); // true
console.log(highpass(5, 6));   // true
console.log(highpass(5, 18));  // true
console.log(highpass(5, 1));   // false
console.log(highpass(5, 3));   // false
console.log(highpass(5, 4));   // false
// A pure function must not rely on any external mutable state, because it would no longer be deterministic or referentially transparent.


//-------------------------
// Examples of an Impure Function
// Mutating its arguments:

 function impureFun(myArray, item) {
     return myArray.push(item);
 }
//  In the above example, we are manipulating the myArray argument and a pure function should not change(manipulate) any part of the code. That's why this is an impure function.


 //------------------
// Returning value dependent on the non-local state:
 const message = 'Hi there! ';
 function myMessage(value) {
     return \`\${message} \${value}\`
 }
 console.log(myMessage('Mudit'));

// Console:
// Hi there! Mudit
// In the above code, the result the function is returning is dependent on the variable that is not declared inside the function, that's why this is an impure function.

In this example, we'll modify the shopping cart directly by mutating it.
<b>Scenario: Adding an item to the cart (Impure function)</b>
Imagine a scenario where you have a shopping cart, and you want to add an item to it. You want to keep track of the <b>items</b> array in the cart, and when you add an item, you directly modify the <b>cart</b>.

<b>Explanation</b>: (Ex : 1)
    <b>Impure function</b>: The <u>addToCart</u> function mutates the <u>cart</u> object directly. The <u>cart.items.push()</u> adds the item to the <u>items</u> array, and it modifies the <u>cart</u> object in place.
    <b>Side effect</b>: The cart is changed immediately when you call the <u>addToCart</u> function. The mutation happens directly on the original <u>cart</u> object.

<b>2. Example Using a Pure Function (No Mutation)</b>
Now, let's see how to implement the same functionality using a <b>pure function</b>, where no data is mutated, and we return a <b>new cart</b> instead.
<b>Scenario: Adding an item to the cart (Pure function)</b>
Here, we want to add an item to the cart, but we <b>return a new cart</b> with the updated items. The original cart stays unchanged.

<b>Explanation</b>:
    => <b>Pure function</b>: The <u>addToCart</u> function <b>does not mutate</b> the original <u>cart</u> object. Instead, it creates a new cart and returns it.
    => The <u>newCart</u> contains the updated <u>items</u> array, while the original <u>cart</u> remains unchanged.
    => <b>No side effects</b>: The original <u>cart</u> is not mutated. Each time you add an item, you create and return a new cart

    <b>Real-World Scenario - Shopping Cart</b>
<b>Scenario 1: Impure Function</b>
    => You have a cart object. When a user adds items to the cart, you directly modify the cart object.
    => <b>Problem</b>: If you want to track the history of the cart (e.g., undo the last action), it's harder because the cart is mutated in place. Other parts of the code might also be affected by the mutation.

<b>Scenario 2: Pure Function</b>
    => You use a new cart object every time an item is added.
    => <b>Benefit</b>: The original cart remains unchanged, so you can keep an immutable history of the cart's state. This makes features like "undo" easier to implement.

          text1: `An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
            
          An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a common JavaScript design pattern used to create a private scope for variables. It involves defining and invoking a function expression immediately after its creation. The primary purpose of an IIFE is to encapsulate variables within a local scope, preventing them from polluting the global scope.
          
          The basic syntax of an IIFE looks like this:`,
          code1: `(function() {
            // code inside this function is executed immediately
          })();`

          text1: `Let's break down the components of this pattern:

          <b>Function Expression:</b>
          (function() { /* code */ }) is a function expression enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses around the function declaration are necessary to distinguish it from a function declaration statement.

          <b>Invocation (()):</b>
          The function is immediately invoked by adding an extra set of parentheses (function() { /* code */ })(). This causes the function to execute immediately after its definition.
          <b>Use Cases</b>:
          Encapsulation and Avoiding Global Scope Pollution:
          Variables declared inside an IIFE are scoped to the function, preventing them from leaking into the global scope.`,

          <b>Module Pattern:</b>
          IIFE is often used in the module pattern, where you can create self-contained modules with private state and expose only the necessary functionalities.`,
          code1: `var module = (function() {
            var privateVar = "I am private";

          The IIFE pattern is a powerful and widely used technique in JavaScript for creating private scopes, avoiding global scope pollution, and implementing modular patterns. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to execute code immediately and keep certain variables or functionalities private.

          In this syntax, the semicolon is used to terminate the statement in case two or more JavaScript files are blindly concatenated into a single file.
          
          For example, you may have two file lib1.js and lib2.js which use IIFEs:
          
          (function(){
              // ...
          })()
              
          (function(){
              // ...
          })()
          
          <i>If you use a code bundler tool to concatenate code from both files into a single file, without the semicolon (;) the concatenated JavaScript code will cause a syntax error.</i>
          
          <b>Advantages and Use Cases</b>
          <b>1. Encapsulation</b>
IIFE provides encapsulation, allowing you to create private scopes for variables and functions. This prevents variable conflicts and unintended modifications of data in the global scope. Encapsulation is crucial in larger applications and when working with multiple libraries.

<b>2. Avoiding Global Pollution</b>
By encapsulating code within IIFE, you avoid polluting the global namespace. This is particularly important when you want to minimize naming clashes with other scripts or libraries in your project. It keeps your code modular and self-contained.

<b>3. Immediate Execution</b>
IIFE executes code immediately after declaration. This feature is beneficial when you need to perform initialization tasks, configure settings, or kickstart an application. It ensures that your code runs exactly when and where you intend.

<b>4. Data Privacy</b>
IIFE allows you to create closures, which help maintain data privacy. You can hide variables and functions inside an IIFE, exposing only what's necessary. This concept is fundamental to the Module Pattern, a widely-used design pattern in JavaScript.

Real-World Scenarios for IIFE
<b>1. Isolating Code</b>
When integrating third-party scripts or libraries, you can wrap them in an IIFE to isolate their functionality and avoid conflicts with your code.

          <b>this Binding:</b>
Arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit the this value from the enclosing scope (lexical scoping). This behavior is different from regular functions, which have their own this context.

<b>arrow functions inherit <u>this</u> from their parent scope</b> (also called <b>lexical scoping</b>). Unlike regular functions, they <b>do not create their own <u>this</u> context</b>. Instead, they use the <u>this</u> value from the surrounding function or execution context.
         
Understanding <b>this</b> in javascript with arrow functions
This post is meant as second part of Understanding <b>This</b> in javascript.

We will go through the same examples, but we will use arrow functions instead to compare the outputs.
The motivation of this second post about the scope is, despite arrow functions are a powerful addition to ES6, they must not be misused or abused.

Default <b>this</b> context
Arrow functions do not bind their own this, instead, they inherit the one from the <b>parent scope</b>, which is called <b>lexical scoping</b>. This makes arrow functions to be a great choice in some scenarios but a very bad one in others

arrow functions do <b>not</b> bind <b>this</b> to the object in which they are defined (unlike regular functions). Instead, <b>this</b> will refer to the global object (or undefined in strict mode)

For <b>arrow functions, this</b> is lexically bound, meaning it takes the value of <b>this</b> from the surrounding code's context. Ex : 2

If we look at the first example but using arrow functions
`,
          code1: `// define a function
          const myFunction = () => {
            console.log(this);
          };
          // call it
myFunction();


//---------     Ex : 2 --------
//Non-Strict Mode:
// The arrow function iAmArrow inherits this from the surrounding scope(global  scope)
// In non-strict mode, the "this" context is the global object (in browsers, "window"). So, this line assigns a property "abc" to the global object "(window.abc = "I am arrow function")".
        this.abc = "I am arrow function"
        const iAmArrow = () => {
            console.log(this) // Window {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: '', location: Location, …}
            console.log(this.abc) // I am arrow function
        }
        iAmArrow()


// Strict Mode:
// In strict mode, "this" is "undefined" in the global context. Attempting to set "this.abc" will throw a "TypeError" because "this" is "undefined", and you cannot assign properties to "undefined".
        "use strict";
        this.abc = "I am arrow function"
        const iAmArrow = () => {
            console.log(this) //undefined
            console.log(this.abc) //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'abc')

          <b>Drawbacks</b>:
          <b>1) No arguments Object</b>:
          Arrow functions do not have their own arguments object. If you need to access the arguments passed to the function, you should use the rest parameters syntax (...args).

          In JavaScript, an iterator is an object that provides a way to access the elements of a collection, one at a time, and in a sequential manner. Iterators are used to traverse data structures like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. They follow a standard interface with methods like next() that returns the next element in the sequence along with information about whether the iteration is complete.

          The iterator protocol defines how to produce a sequence of values from an object.
          An object becomes an iterator when it implements a next() method.


          Iterator Interface:
          An iterator must adhere to the following interface:

          <b>next() Method:</b>
          The next() method returns an object with two properties:
          value: the next element in the iteration.
          done: a boolean indicating whether the iteration is complete (true when the last element is reached).
          Here's a simple example of creating an iterator for an array:`,
          code1: `const iterableArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          const iterator = iterableArray[Symbol.iterator]();

          Closure in JavaScript is a form of lexical scoping used to preserve variables from the outer scope of a function in the inner scope of a function.

In JavaScript, a closure is a feature that allows a function to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executed outside that lexical scope. In simpler terms, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function even after the outer function has finished executing.

A closure is created when a function retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. This characteristic allows functions to maintain a private state and preserve variable values without exposing them globally, making closures particularly useful for data encapsulation.
Exactly! One of the powerful features of closures in JavaScript is their ability to encapsulate and hide variables from the global scope, making them private.

A closure is a function that has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This is possible because the inner function retains a reference to the scope of the outer function, even after the outer function has been executed.

          In other words, closure is created when a child function keep the environment of the parent scope even after the parent function has already executed 

         <u> Variables created without a declaration keyword <b>(var, let, or const)</b> are always global, even if they are created inside a function.</u>
          In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function is defined within another function, allowing the inner function to access variables from the outer (enclosing) function's scope. Closures have access to the outer function's variables, parameters, and even the outer function's this context. This provides a way to create private variables, maintain state, and create functions with behavior that depends on their lexical environment.

        
          A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the <b>lexical environment</b>). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

          <b>Understanding Closures</b>
A closure occurs when a function retains access to the variables and parameters of its outer function even after the outer function has finished execution. This means that the inner function can still access and modify variables that were in its surrounding scope at the time the closure was created.

 Here are a few examples of closures in JavaScript:`,
          code1: `function outerFunction() {
            var outerVariable = 'I am from outerFunction';
            
            function innerFunction() {
              console.log(outerVariable); // innerFunction has access to outerVariable
            }
            
            return innerFunction; // Return the inner function
          }
          
          var inner = outerFunction(); // inner now holds a reference to innerFunction
          inner(); // When inner is executed, it still has access to outerVariable through closure
          `
        },
        {
          text1: ` In above example, <b>innerFunction</b> has access to the <b>outerVariable</b> even though it's declared in the <b>outerFunction</b>, and <b>outerFunction</b> has already finished executing. This is possible because of closure.

          <b>Lexical Scope:</b> In JavaScript, variables defined outside of a function are accessible inside the function. This is called lexical scope.
          
          <b>Inner Functions:</b> Functions defined inside another function are called inner functions. These inner functions have access to the variables declared in the outer function, as well as to the global scope.
          
          <b>Closure:</b> When an inner function is returned from the outer function and survives beyond the life of the outer function, it maintains access to the variables and parameters of that outer function, even though the outer function has completed execution. This phenomenon is called closure.`,
          code1: `// Example 2: Private Variables
function counter() {
  let count = 0;  // This is the "private" variable

  return function() {
    count++;  // The inner function has access to \`count\`
    console.log(count);  // Prints the updated value of \`count\`
  };
}

const increment = counter();  // \`increment\` is a reference to the inner function
increment();  // Outputs: 1
increment();  // Outputs: 2

          // Here, the inner function within counter forms a closure, and count is a private variable accessible only within that closure. This creates a way to have private state in JavaScript.
          
    //      **** How It Works: ****
    // *** Outer Function (counter): ***
    //     The "counter" function defines a variable "count" initialized to 0.
    //     It returns an inner function that increments "count" and prints its value.
    // *** The Closure: ***
    //     The inner function returned by counter() forms a "closure" because it "remembers" the environment in which it was created. In this case, it "remembers" the variable "count" from the outer counter() function.
    // *** Calling increment(): ***
    //     When increment() is called for the first time, it increases "count" from 0 to 1 and logs 1 to the console.
    //     When increment() is called a second time, "count" has persisted from the previous call (because of the closure) and is now 1. It increments it to 2 and logs 2 to the console.

          // Example 3: Function Factory
          function createMultiplier(factor) {

          }
          const double = createMultiplier(2);
          console.log(double(5)); // Outputs: 10
          // In this example, createMultiplier is a function factory that generates closure functions. The closure function (double) created with a specific factor retains access to that factor when invoked later.

              });
          }
          createButtonHandler('btn1');
          createButtonHandler('btn2');
          // In this example, createButtonHandler is a function that creates event handlers for different buttons. Each handler forms a closure, capturing the buttonId parameter and referencing the button variable from the outer function.

          console.log(multiplyByTwo(5)); // Outputs: 10
          // Here, multiplier returns a function that can be used to multiply a number by a specified factor. The inner function retains access to the factor parameter of its outer function, creating a closure.

          text1: `<b>Key Things to Consider In Below example</b>:
    <b>setTimeout Delays</b>: The <b>setTimeout()</b> function schedules the callback to run after a certain delay, and it does not block the rest of the code execution. This means that the loop will <b>complete</b> first, and then the callbacks (for <b>setTimeout</b>) will be executed <b>after the loop finishes</b>.

    <b>Loop with var</b>: When you use <b>var</b>, the variable <b>i</b> is shared across all iterations of the loop. However, the callbacks inside <b>setTimeout()</b> are scheduled for later execution. By the time they are executed, the value of <b>i</b> has already been updated to <b>4</b> in the last iteration, and each <b>setTimeout</b> callback will reference this <b>final value</b> of <b>i</b>.
    
    <b>Why It Might Work in Your Case</b>:
Your code works as expected (producing 1 2 3 4) because the setTimeout() callbacks are using the <b>inc argument</b>, which correctly captures the value of <b>i</b> at the time the <b>clo(i)</b> function was called. In this case, the value of <b>inc</b> (which is equal to <b>i</b> when passed to <b>clo()</b>) remains <b>stably bound</b> within each <b>closure</b>, and <b>does not reference <i>i</i> after the loop ends</b>.

<u>So, the output order becomes</u>:
    After the first second, 1 is printed.
    After the second second, 2 is printed.
    After the third second, 3 is printed.
    After the fourth second, 4 is printed.

          In this code snippet, you're using <b>setTimeout</b> inside a loop to create three alerts, each displaying the value of i. However, due to the asynchronous nature of <b>setTimeout</b>, the alerts won't display as you might expect.

          Here's what happens:
          
          The loop starts, and i is initialized to 0.
          The first <b>setTimeout</b> is called with a delay of 1000 milliseconds. Since i is 0, the alert function is created to alert 0.
          The loop continues, and i becomes 1.
          The second <b>setTimeout</b> is called with a delay of 1001 milliseconds. Now, the alert function captures the current value of i, which is 1.
          The loop continues, and i becomes 2.
          The third <b>setTimeout</b> is called with a delay of 1002 milliseconds. Again, the alert function captures the current value of i, which is 2.
          By the time the alerts are triggered (after the specified delays), the value of i has already been updated to 3 due to the loop completing. Therefore, all three alerts display 3.`,
          code1: `for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            setTimeout(function() { alert(i); }, 1000 + i);

          // If you want each alert to display the corresponding value of i (0, 1, 2) after the specified delays, you need to create a closure to capture the current value of i at each iteration. You can achieve this by using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) like this:

          Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class or a function. It promotes the idea of hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only the necessary functionalities to interact with that object.

          Closures allow you to create private variables and functions within a scope. This means that you can encapsulate certain data and functionality, preventing them from being accessed or modified from outside the closure. This is particularly useful when you want to hide implementation details and expose only a limited interface to other parts of your code.
        
          In Below example, we have a <b>createBook</b> function that takes a <b>title</b> and an <b>author</b> as arguments and returns an object with four methods: <b>getTitle</b>, <b>getAuthor</b>, <b>setTitle</b>, and <b>setAuthor</b>. These methods allow us to retrieve or update the values of the <b>_title</b> and <b>_author</b> variables, which are private to the <b>createBook</b> function and not accessible outside of it.

          In Below example, the <b>createTimer</b> function creates a closure that increments the <b>seconds</b> variable every second using <b>setInterval</b>. The closure retains the value of <b>seconds</b> even after the <b>createTimer</b> function has finished executing. This allows the timer to continue running and displaying the elapsed time.
          <u>Ex: 2---</u>
          In Below example, the <b>createCounter</b> function returns a function that increments and returns the value of the <b>count</b> variable each time it is called. Because the returned function is a closure, it keeps access to the <b>count</b> variable even after the <b>createCounter</b> function has returned, allowing it to maintain states across multiple function calls.

          Closures can also be used for memoization, which is a technique to optimize the performance of functions by caching their results. By caching the results of expensive calculations, you can avoid redundant computations and improve the overall performance of your code.
          
          Memorization is a technique that involves storing the results of expensive or time-consuming calculations in a cache or lookup table so that they can be quickly retrieved the next time the same calculation is needed. It can greatly improve the performance of a function or algorithm, especially if it is called multiple times with the same arguments.
          
          // Ex : 1--
          In the example above, the <b>memoizedAdd</b> function returns an inner function that calculates the sum of two numbers. The results of previous calculations are stored in the <b>cache</b> object. Before performing a new calculation, the inner function checks if the result for the given input parameters already exists in the cache. If it does, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing it.
          `,
          code1: `

          When working with asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or fetching data from a database, it is common to encounter situations where you need to handle the result of the operation once it completes.  Closures can help you manage this by capturing the state of variables at the time the asynchronous operation is initiated.

<b>1) Explicit Control Over this</b>:
-> <b>call()</b> allows you to explicitly specify the value of <b>this</b> when invoking a function. This is particularly useful when you want to control the context in which a function operates, rather than relying on the default behavior of <b>this</b>.
-> In JavaScript, <b>this</b> can refer to different things depending on how and where a function is called, so controlling this ensures the correct behavior.

function greet(name) {
    console.log(\`\${this.name} says Hello to \${name}\`);
}
const person = { name: 'Alice' };
greet.call(person, 'Bob'); // Alice says Hello to Bob

<b>2) Method Borrowing</b>:
-> <b>Borrowing methods</b> from one object and using them with another object is a key benefit of <b>call()</b>. It allows you to reuse functionality from one context (or object) on another.
-> This is useful when you want to reuse an existing method without having to redefine it or copy its code.

    }
};
const anotherPerson = { name: 'Bob' };
// Borrowing the greet method from person
person.greet.call(anotherPerson); // Hello, my name is Bob


<b>3) Multiple Arguments Passed</b>:
With <b>call()</b>, you can pass arguments individually to the function, allowing you to control the function's input parameters in a very precise manner.

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add.call(null, 5, 10)); // 15


<b>4) Function Overloading</b>:
You can use <b>call()</b> to invoke a function with different arguments in different contexts, essentially simulating <b>function overloading</b>. This can be helpful when you want a function to behave differently based on the context in which it's called.


<b>5) Can Be Used with Constructor Functions</b>:
You can use <b>call()</b> with constructor functions to create instances of objects and set the this value explicitly. This can be especially useful for setting up inheritance and chaining constructors.

function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
function Dog(name, breed) {
    Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
}
const myDog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
console.log(myDog.name); // Buddy
console.log(myDog.breed); // Golden Retriever


<b>Enabling Function Chaining</b>:
<b>call()</b> is useful when you want to chain multiple functions together, especially in object-oriented patterns or with method chaining.

function Calculator() {
    this.result = 0;
    this.add = function (value) {
        this.result += value;

          The call() method takes arguments separately.
          The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
    
          The apply() method in JavaScript is a built-in method that allows you to call a function with a specified this value and an array or array-like object of arguments. It is similar to the call() method, but instead of passing arguments one by one, you can pass them as an array.
    
          => Using the apply() method to append an array to another
          => The apply() method allows you to append elements of an array to another:

          In this example, the apply() method modifies the original array arr. Note that the Array.prototype.concat() method also provides the same result except that it returns the new array instead of modifying the original array.
          
          The syntax for the apply() method is as follows:

          <span style="color:red"> functionName.apply(thisValue, [arg1, arg2, ...]);</span>

          <b>functionName</b>: The function to be called.
          <b>thisValue</b>: The value to be passed as the this parameter when the function is called.
          <b>[arg1, arg2, ...]</b>: An array or array-like object containing the arguments to be passed to the function.
          `,
          code1: `function sayHello(greeting, punctuation) {
            console.log('\${greeting}, \${this.name} \${punctuation}');
        }
  
        const person = {
            name: 'John'
        };
  
        sayHello.apply(person, ['Hi', '!']); // Outputs: "Hi, John!"
        // In this example, sayHello.apply(person, ['Hi', '!']) calls the sayHello function with person as the value of this and the array ['Hi', '!'] as the arguments, resulting in the message "Hi, John!" being logged to the console.`

        {
          text1: `apply() is particularly useful when you have a function that accepts a variable number of arguments or when you want to pass an array of arguments dynamically.

          It's worth noting that in modern JavaScript, you can often achieve the same result using the spread operator (...) to pass an array of arguments directly to a function:
 
          <span style="color:red">sayHello.call(person, ...['Hi', '!']);</span>
          Both <b>apply()</b> and <b>call()</b> are similar, but the choice between them depends on how the arguments are structured: 
          apply() takes an array, while call() takes individual arguments. If you have an array of arguments, apply() can be more convenient.`,

          text1: `<a href="https://javascript.info/callbacks" target="_blank">callbacks</a>
          In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of some asynchronous operation or at a later time. 
      
          Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, especially in scenarios like event handling, asynchronous operations, and dealing with functions that take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server.
    
          We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
    
          when we have a function that might take a long time to complete, oftentimes we provide a callback function. This function encapsulates the code we would like to run at a later time when the blocking action (e.g a network call) has been resolved. This allows us to return control to the JS engine and defer the rest of the execution until after the call-stack has been cleared. This is the concept of asynchrony in JavaScript.
          
          Here's a simple example of a callback function:`,
          code1: `function fetchData(callback) {
            // Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from a server)
            setTimeout(function() {
              const data = "This is the fetched data";
              // Calling the callback function and passing the fetched data as an argument
              callback(data);
            }, 2000); // Simulating a 2-second delay
          }
          
          function handleData(data) {
            console.log("Handling data:", data);
          }`
        },
        {
          text1: `// Calling fetchData and passing handleData as a callback function
          fetchData(handleData);
          In this example, fetchData is a function that simulates an asynchronous operation with a 2-second delay. It takes a callback function (handleData) as an argument and calls it with the fetched data after the operation is complete.
          
          Callback functions are crucial in scenarios where you want to ensure that certain code runs only after a specific operation is finished, especially when dealing with asynchronous tasks like AJAX requests, file I/O, or timers.
          
          It's worth noting that with the introduction of Promises and async/await in JavaScript, there are alternative ways to handle asynchronous operations that often result in more readable and maintainable code. However, understanding callbacks remains important as they are still widely used in JavaScript development.`,

<b>Object.freeze()</b> prevents mutability.

The <b>Object.freeze()</b> static method freezes an object. Freezing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable and non-configurable. A frozen object can no longer be changed: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability, configurability, writability, or value cannot be changed, and the object's prototype cannot be re-assigned. freeze() returns the same object that was passed in.

<b>freeze()</b> returns the same object that was passed into the function. It does not create a frozen copy.

The Object.freeze() method is shallow, meaning that it can freeze the properties of the object, not the objects referenced by the properties. 

The <u>Object.freeze()</u> method freezes an object i.e. it prevents the object from being modified.

Object.freeze method makes the object completely read-only, but it's only doing a shallow freeze, which means that it will only freeze the immediate properties of the object itself. If the object contains an array or object as a property, those properties can still be modified.

<u>Object.freeze</u> makes an object completely immutable, while <u>Object.seal</u> allows existing properties to be modified, but prevents the addition and deletion of new properties.

-> <b>freeze() </b> is a static method. Hence, we need to access the method using the class name, Object.

Notes: A frozen object can no longer be changed. Freezing an object prevents:
=> New properties from being added to the object.
=> Existing properties to be removed from the object.
=> Changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties.
=> Changing the values of existing object properties and prototypes.

      title: "Constructor Function",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `It seems there might be a slight confusion in terminology. In JavaScript, constructors and constructor functions typically refer to the same concept. A constructor function is a regular JavaScript function used to create and initialize objects within a class or a constructor function.
          
          <b>Constructor Function</b>:
A constructor function is a regular JavaScript function that is used to create instances of objects. It's called a constructor because it's invoked using the new keyword to construct or create new objects.

<b>Purpose of Constructor Functions</b>:
Constructor functions serve as blueprints for creating objects with similar properties and methods. They encapsulate the initialization logic for objects, allowing for the creation of multiple instances with shared behaviors. Constructor functions are fundamental to object-oriented programming in JavaScript and are used extensively to define object types and their behavior.

Technically speaking, a constructor function is a regular function with the following convention:

> The name of a constructor function starts with a capital letter like <b>Person, Document</b>, etc.
> A constructor function should be called only with the <b>new</b> operator.
          `,
          code1: `The following example defines a constructor function called Person:

          function Person(firstName, lastName) {
              this.firstName = firstName;
              this.lastName = lastName;
          }`
        },
        {
          text1: `In this example, the <b>Person</b> is the same as a regular function except that its name starts with the capital letter <b>P</b>.

          To create a new instance of the <b>Person</b>, you use the <b>new</b> operator:
          
          let person = new Person('John','Doe');
          Basically, the <b>new</b> operator does the following:
          
          > Create a new empty object and assign it to the <b>this</b> variable.
          > Assign the arguments <b>John</b> and <b>Doe</b> to the <b>firstName</b> and <b>lastName</b> properties of the object.
          > Return the <b>this</b> value.

          It's functionally equivalent to the following:`,
          code1: `function Person(firstName, lastName) {
            // this = {};
        
            // add properties to this
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        
            // return this;
        }
       
        // Therefore, the following statement:
        
        let person = new Person('John','Doe');
       
        // … returns the same result as the following statement:
        
        let person = {
            firstName: 'John',
            lastName: 'Doe'
        };
       
        // However, the constructor function 'Person' allows you to create multiple similar objects. For example:
        
        let person1 = new Person('Jane','Doe')
        let person2 = new Person('James','Smith')`
        },
        {
          text1: `<b>Adding methods to JavaScript constructor functions</b>
          An object may have methods that manipulate its data. To add a method to an object created via the constructor function, you can use the <b>this</b> keyword. For example:`,
          code1: `function Person(firstName, lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        
            this.getFullName = function () {
                return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            };

            Now, you can create a new 'Person' object and invoke the 'getFullName()' method:

let person = new Person("John", "Doe");
console.log(person.getFullName());

// Output:
// John Doe

        }`
        },
        {
          text1: `The problem with the constructor function is that when you create multiple instances of the <b>Person</b>, the <b>this.getFullName()</b> is duplicated in every instance, which is not memory efficient.

          To resolve this, you can use the <a href="#Prototypes">prototype</a> so that all instances of a custom type can share the same methods.
          
         <b> Returning from constructor functions</b>
Typically, a constructor function implicitly returns <b>this</b> that set to the newly created object. But if it has a <b>return</b> statement, then here are the rules:

If <b>return</b> is called with an object, the constructor function returns that object instead of <b>this</b>.
If <b>return</b> is called with a value other than an object, it is ignored.

<b>Calling a constructor function without the new keyword</b>
Technically, you can call a constructor function like a regular function without using the new keyword like this:

<span style="color:red"> let person = Person('John','Doe');</span>

In this case, the <b>Person</b> just executes like a regular function. Therefore, the <b>this</b> inside the <b>Person</b> function doesn't bind to the <b>person</b> variable but the global object.

If you attempt to access the <b>firstName</b> or <b>lastName</b> property, you'll get an error:

console.log(person.firstName);
Error:

TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstName' of undefined
Similarly, you cannot access the <b>getFullName()</b> method since it's bound to the global object.

person.getFullName();
Error:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'getFullName' of undefined

To prevent a constructor function from being invoked without the <b>new</b> keyword, ES6 introduced the new.target property.

If a constructor function is called with the <b>new</b> keyword, the <b>new.target</b> returns a reference of the function. Otherwise, it returns <b>undefined</b>.

The following adds a statement to the <b>Person</b> function to show the <b>new.target</b> to the console:
          `,
          code1: `function Person(firstName, lastName) {
            console.log(new.target);
        
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName  = lastName;
        
            this.getFullName = function () {
                return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            };
        }
        
        
        // The following returns 'undefined' because the 'Person' constructor function is called like a regular function:

let person = Person("John", "Doe");
// Output:
// undefined

// However, the following returns a reference to the 'Person' function because it's called the 'new' keyword:

let person = new Person("John", "Doe");
Output:
[Function: Person]

// By using the 'new.target', you can force the callers of the constructor function to use the 'new' keyword. Otherwise, you can throw an error like this:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    if (!new.target) {
        throw Error("Cannot be called without the new keyword");
    }

    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

// Alternatively, you can make the syntax more flexible by creating a new 'Person' object if the users of the constructor function don't use the 'new' keyword:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    if (!new.target) {
        return new Person(firstName, lastName);
    }

    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

let person = Person("John", "Doe");

console.log(person.firstName);

// This pattern is often used in JavaScript libraries and frameworks to make the syntax more flexible.

        text1: `// In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which is essentially a reference to another object called its prototype. This prototype is a  fundamental concept in JavaScript's object-oriented programming model.

        In JavaScript, prototypes allow properties and methods to be shared among instances of the function or object
        <b>Prototype in Javascript</b>
In JavaScript, a prototype is a mechanism through which objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every object has a prototype, forming a prototype chain. When an object is created, it inherits properties and methods from its prototype, and this chain continues until a prototype with null is reached.

        In JavaScript, everything is an object, including functions, arrays, and strings, which are specialized types of objects. JavaScript follows a prototype-based system, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes. This prototype mechanism plays a key role in how JavaScript handles inheritance and object relationships.

        <b>prototype:</b>: JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that it uses
        prototypes to inherit properties and methods from one object to another. In JavaScript, objects can be linked to other objects, forming a prototype chain. When a property or method is accessed on an object, the  JavaScript engine first checks if that property  or  method exists on the object itself. If it does not, it will check the object's  prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. If the property or method is not found, it will return undefined.

        // Here's a clear breakdown:
        <b>Every object has a prototype</b>: When you create an object in JavaScript, it
        automatically gets a prototype. This prototype is a regular JavaScript object
        itself, and it can have its own properties and methods.

        <b>The prototype chain</b>: When you try to access a property or method on an object,
        JavaScript first checks if that property or method exists on the object itself. If it
        doesn't find it, it looks at the object's prototype, and if it's not there, it continues
        up the prototype chain until it finds the property or method or reaches the end of  the
        chain (where the prototype is null).

        // both __proto__ and prototype are related to object inheritance, but they serve
        different purposes.

        <b>__proto__:</b>
        <b>__proto__</b> is a property that exists on every object in JavaScript.
        It's a reference to the prototype object from which the current object inherits.
        When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if
        that
        property or method exists directly on the object itself.If it doesn't, JavaScript
        looks
        at the object's <b>__proto__</b> to find it.This process continues up the prototype chain
        until
        the property or method is found or until the end of the chain is reached(i.e., when
        <b>__proto__</b> becomes null).
        It's important to note that <b>__proto__</b> is considered deprecated and should not be
        used
        for production code. Instead, you should use Object.getPrototypeOf() to get the
        prototype of an object, and Object.setPrototypeOf() to set the prototype of an
        object.

        <b>prototype:</b>
        // prototype is a property that exists on constructor functions in JavaScript.
        // It's used to set up inheritance when you want to create objects using the new
        keyword.
        // When you create a constructor function and add properties or methods to its
        prototype, those properties and methods become available to instances created using
        that
        constructor function.
        // When you use the new keyword to create an instance of a constructor function, the
        newly created object's __proto__ is set to the constructor function's prototype.
        // In summary, __proto__ is a property that exists on every object and is used to
        reference the prototype of the object, while prototype is a property that exists on
        constructor functions and is used to set up inheritance for objects created using
        those
        constructor functions.

          text1: `Short circuiting works by evaluating an expression from left to right and returning the value of the first operand that determines the final result.
          
          In the case of OR, the expression is evaluated until we get one true result because the result will always be true, independent of the further conditions. If there is an expression with ||(logical OR), and the first operand itself is true, then a short circuit occurs, evaluation stops, and true is returned. OR short-circuiting can also be used to replace if else statements just like AND short-circuiting in JavaScript. In JavaScript true||expression always returns true and the false || expression always returns the expression.

        The logical OR operator (<b>||</b>) returns <b>true</b> if at least one of its operands is <b>true</b>, and it returns <b>false</b> only if both operands are <b>false</b>. Like the <b>&&</b> operator, it also short-circuits its evaluation. If the left operand is <b>true</b>, there's no need to evaluate the right operand because the result is already determined to be <b>true</b>.

        <b>Logical OR (||)</b>: When using ||, if the first operand evaluates to true, the second operand is not evaluated because the result of the OR operation will always be true regardless of the second operand's value. Again, this is short-circuiting. For example:
        <span style="color:red">
        if (condition1 || condition2) {
        Code block
        }
        </span>
        // Here, if <b>condition1</b> evaluates to true, <b>condition2</b> will not be evaluated because the overall result of the <b>||</b> operation will be true anyway.

        // Short circuiting can be useful for improving performance and preventing potential errors, especially when the evaluation of the second operand involves complex or expensive operations, or when evaluating it could lead to unintended side effects.

        // in the case of the OR operator, short circuiting means that if the first value is a truthy value, it will immediately return that first value.

          In JavaScript, the <b>this</b> keyword always refers to an object. The thing about it is that the object it refers to will vary depending on how and where this is being called.
    
          The value of this depends on how a function is called:
          
          <b>1) Global Context:</b>
          When used outside of any function, <b>this</b> refers to the global object. In a browser environment, the global object is <b>window</b>.
          
          
          <b>2) Function Context:</b>
          When used within a function, the value of <b>this</b> depends on how the function is called.
          If the function is called as a method of an object, <b>this</b> refers to the object itself.
          If the function is called as a standalone function, <b>this</b> refers to the global object (<b>window</b> in browsers) in non-strict mode, or it is <b>undefined</b> in strict mode.
    
          <b>A note about arrow functions:</b>
          In arrow functions, JavaScript sets the this lexically. This means that the arrow function doesn't create its own execution context but inherits the this from the outer function where the arrow function is defined.
    
          In most cases, this means this will refer to the window object as well:

          How to Use this in an Event Listener
    
          When using <b>this</b> in an event listener, this will refer to the DOM element that fired the event.`,

          <b>'this' Methods (call, apply and bind):</b>
          To complicate the subject a little more, javascript provides three native methods that can be used to manipulate the way the this keyword behaves. These methods are <b>call</b>, <b>apply</b> and <b>bind</b>. Let's see how they work.
    
          Here are some examples to illustrate the usage of <b>this</b>:`,
          code1: `      // Global context
          console.log(this === window); // true
          
          // Method context
          const obj = {
            name: 'Object',
            greet() {
              console.log('Hello, \${this.name}!');
            }
          };
          obj.greet(); // Output: "Hello, Object!"
          
          // Constructor context
          function Person(name) {
            this.name = name;
          }
          const person1 = new Person('John');
          console.log(person1.name); // Output: "John"
          
          // Event handler context (assuming button is an HTML button element)
          const button = document.querySelector ('button');
          button.addEventListener ('click', function() {
            console.log(this); // Output: HTMLButtonElement
          });`

          text1: `Understanding the context of <b>this</b> is essential for working effectively with objects, constructors, and event handling in JavaScript.

          text1: `Set is similar to an <b>array</b> that allows us to store multiple items like <b>numbers, strings, objects</b>, etc. However, unlike an array, a set cannot contain duplicate values.
          
          A Set is a collection of unique values of any data type where each <b>value can occur only once</b>. It stores data like an Array, which is a list of values and not key-value pairs like a Map or Object. Each element in a Set is distinct and stands alone without any inherent relationship to other elements.

          <b>How to create a Set</b>:
1) Using Set.add():--
const set= new Set();
set.add('Muskaan')
set.add('Mango')

2. Passing Array to new Set()
const set= new Set(['Muskaan', 'Mango'])

<b>Both yield the same output</b>:
Set(2) 
0: "Muskaan"
1: "Mango"
size: 2

Since Sets can only contain unique values, any attempt to add a value that already exists will be ignored.
set.add('Mango') // set will still have two values

<b>Methods</b>:
1 <b>delete(value)</b> → Removes the specified item from a Set
Returns true if value was already in Set, otherwise false.
set.delete('mango');
// output: false -> case-sensitive
set.delete('Mango');
// output: true

2. <b>has(value)</b> → Returns true if a value exists, else false
set.has('Muskaan');
// output: true

3. <b>intersection(set)</b> → A new Set object containing elements in both the parameter set and the other set.
const fruits = new Set(['Apple', 'Mango', 'Guava']);
console.log(fruits.intersection(set)); 
// output: Set(1) {'Mango'}

4. <b>isSubsetOf(set)</b> → Returns true if all elements in the parameter set are also in the other set, and false otherwise.
const firstSet = new Set([3, 5, 13, 17]);
const secondSet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 19]);
console.log(firstSet.isSubsetOf(secondSet)); 
// output: true

// Set with multiple types of value
const set2 = new Set([1, 'hello', {count : true}]);

           <b>Characteristics of Accessor Properties</b>
           Accessor properties have the following characteristics:

           Getters: Functions that are called when the property is accessed.
           Setters: Functions that are called when a new value is assigned to the property.
           No Direct Storage: Unlike data properties, accessor properties do not store
          values directly. The getter and setter functions handle value retrieval and
          assignment.
           Flexibility: Accessor properties provide a way to add logic to the process of
          getting and setting property values, which can be useful for validation, computed
          properties, and encapsulation.

           <b>Object.defineProperty()</b>

           The Object.defineProperty() method adds a property or modifies an existing
          property on an object and returns the object.

           The syntax of the defineProperty() method is:

           Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
           Here, 'defineProperty()' is a static method. Hence, we need to access the method
          using the class name, Object.


           defineProperty() Parameters
           The 'defineProperty()' method takes in:

           'obj' - the object on which to define the property.
           'prop' - the name or 'Symbol' of the property to be defined or modified.
           'descriptor' - the descriptor for the property being defined or modified.

           Each property value must either be a data descriptor or an accessor
          descriptor.They can have the following optional properties:

           configurable - the ability to change or delete a property's attributes
           enumerable - the property that is visible in for...in loops and with
          Object.keys().
           Data descriptors can also have:

          value - the actual data stored in a property, accessible through its key.
          writable - the ability to change the value of a property.If false, the property's
          value cannot be changed.`,

          <b>Encapsulation</b>: Enhances encapsulation by ensuring that the internal state of an object cannot be tampered with from outside the class.

          text1: `Private methods in JavaScript are methods that are accessible only within the class where they are defined. They are part of the class's internal implementation and cannot be accessed or called from outside the class, even by instances of the class. Private methods are denoted by a <b>#</b> prefix, similar to private fields.

          <b>Defining Private Methods</b>
          Private methods are defined within a class using the <b>#</b> prefix before the method name. These methods can be called from other methods within the same class but are not accessible from outside the class.
          
          To make a public method private, you prefix its name with a hash #. JavaScript allows you to define private methods for instance methods, <b>static methods</b>, and <b>getter/setters</b>.

The following shows the syntax of defining a private instance method:
          `,
          code1: `class MyClass {
            #privateMethod() {
              //...

          console.log(person.#getGreeting()); // SyntaxError: Private field '#getGreeting' must be declared in an enclosing class

          The following shows the syntax of the private getters/setters:

          </span>
          
          In this example, the <b>#myField</b> is the private getter and setter that provides access to the private field <b>#field</b>.
          
          In practice, you use private methods to minimize the number of methods that the object exposes.
          
          As a rule of thumb, you should make all class methods private by default first. And then you make a method public whenever the object needs to use that method to interact with other objects.`,

          <b>Promise</b> : An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation
          (or)
          <b>Promise</b> : A container for an asynchronously delivered value.
          (or)
          <b>Promise</b> : A container for a future value.

          In JavaScript, a <b>Promise</b> is a special object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly compared to traditional callback functions.

          <b>Description</b>
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

<b>What is a Promise?</b>
A Promise has three states:
<b>Pending</b>: The initial state. The operation is ongoing, and the final value isn't available yet.
<b>Fulfilled</b>: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resolved value.
<b>Rejected</b>: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
Creating a Promise
You create a promise using the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two arguments: <u>resolve</u> and <u>reject</u>. These are functions you call to transition the promise from the pending state to either fulfilled or rejected.

A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. If the operation is successful, the process ends in a fulfilled state. And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.

For example, when you request data from the server by using a promise, it will be in a pending state. When the data arrives successfully, it will be in a fulfilled state. If an error occurs, then it will be in a rejected state.



a promise is an object that represents the initial evaluation and eventual result of an asynchronous operation in one of three states pending, fulfilled, and rejected. In any asynchronous operation, a promise will:

=> exists first in a <u>pending</u> state while the operation is being evaluated or processed
=> proceed to be <u>settled</u> in either a <u>fulfilled</u> state if the operation is completed successfully or a <u>rejected</u> state and consequently throws an error if the operation fails.

The code block below shows a practical example of how to work with promises. First, we initiate a <u>new promise</u> using the <u>Promise constructor</u> and pass a callback function to the constructor containing the code we wish to run asynchronously. The first and second parameters of this callback automatically provide us with two functions; The first function (commonly named the <u>resolve</u> function) takes in an argument that would be the result of the promise if the asynchronous operation is completed (fulfilled). On the other hand, the second function (commonly named the <u>reject</u> function) takes in an argument that would be the error thrown by the promise when the asynchronous fails to complete successfully(rejected). When working with a promise, we would commonly chain to it two types of handler methods that hold code that will run only after the promise has been <b>settled</b>.

When the executor obtains the result, be it soon or late, doesn't matter, it should call one of these callbacks:

The idea of <u>finally</u> is to set up a handler for performing cleanup/finalizing after the previous operations are complete.

E.g. stopping loading indicators, closing no longer needed connections, etc.

Think of it as a party finisher. No matter was a party good or bad, how many friends were in it, we still need (or at least should) do a cleanup after it.

1) A <u>finally</u> handler has no arguments. In <u>finally</u> we don't know whether the promise is successful or not. That's all right, as our task is usually to perform “general” finalizing procedures.
Please take a look at the example above: as you can see, the finally handler has no arguments, and the promise outcome is handled by the next handler.

2) A <u>finally</u> handler “passes through” the result or error to the next suitable handler.
For instance, here the result is passed through finally to then:`,
          code1: `//The code may look like this:
          // new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  /* do something that takes time, and then call resolve or maybe reject */
})
  // runs when the promise is settled, doesn't matter successfully or not
  .finally(() => stop loading indicator)
  // so the loading indicator is always stopped before we go on
  .then(result => show result, err => show error)
  
  
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("value"), 2000);
})
  .finally(() => alert("Promise ready")) // triggers first
  .then(result => alert(result)); // <-- .then shows "value"`
        },
        {
          text1: `As you can see, the <u>value</u> returned by the first promise is passed through <u>finally</u> to the next <u>then</u>.
That's very convenient, because <u>finally</u> is not meant to process a promise result. As said, it's a place to do generic cleanup, no matter what the outcome was.
And here's an example of an error, for us to see how it's passed through <u>finally</u> to <u>catch</u>:

3) A <u>finally</u> handler also shouldn't return anything. If it does, the returned value is silently ignored.
The only exception to this rule is when a <u>finally</u> handler throws an error. Then this error goes to the next handler, instead of any previous outcome.

To summarize:
A <u>finally</u> handler doesn't get the outcome of the previous handler (it has no arguments). This outcome is passed through instead, to the next suitable handler.
If a <u>finally</u> handler returns something, it's ignored.
When <u>finally</u> throws an error, then the execution goes to the nearest error handler.
These features are helpful and make things work just the right way if we use finally how it's supposed to be used: for generic cleanup procedures.`,
          code1: `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error("error");
})
  .finally(() => alert("Promise ready")) // triggers first
  .catch(err => alert(err));  // <-- .catch shows the error`

      title: "Promise Chaining",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
          Chaining: When you chain promises, you can perform a series of asynchronous operations in a specific order. Each .then() method returns a new promise, which can be used to perform the next asynchronous operation.
          
          <b> Running promises sequentially </b>
          Sequential execution of promises means that when we have multiple promises, they will be run in the order in which they appear. Each promise must wait for the completion of the previous one before beginning its execution. 

          <b> Promise Chain (Sequential Execution) </b>
    => Promises are executed <b>one after another</b>.
    => Each promise <b>waits for the previous one</b> to resolve before starting.
    => Used when tasks are <b>dependent</b> or must run in <b>order</b>.

          A common need is to execute two or more asynchronous operations back to back, where each subsequent operation starts when the previous operation succeeds, with the result from the previous step. In the old days, doing several asynchronous operations in a row would lead to the classic callback hell:
          
          With promises, we accomplish this by creating a promise chain. The API design of promises makes this great, because callbacks are attached to the returned promise object, instead of being passed into a function.
          
          const promise = doSomething();
const promise2 = promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);

          This second promise (promise2) represents the completion not just of doSomething(), but also of the successCallback or failureCallback you passed in — which can be other asynchronous functions returning a promise. When that's the case, any callbacks added to promise2 get queued behind the promise returned by either successCallback or failureCallback.

          Promises are not just the mechanism to performif this occurs then do that sort of operation. That's the building block, but it turns out we can string multiple promises together to represent a sequence of operations. Understanding promise chaining is the building block to understanding javascript async/await.

The key to making this work is built on the fact that:
Every time you call then(), catch() on a promise, it creates and returns a new promise which can be chained further.

<b>Function definition of then() and catch()</b>
- <b>then(onFulfilled, onRejected)</b>: It takes two arguments as the callback functions. One for handling the fulfilled state (success handler) and the other for handling the rejected state(error handler) of the promise. Both the callback functions return a promise object.
- <b>catch(onRejected)</b>: It takes one argument as the callback function i.e to handle the rejected state of the promise. The callback function onRejected also returns a promise object.

<b>1. Chaining multiple synchronous tasks using .then()</b>
Let's understand the synchronous task chaining with a simple example of a number game wherein each <b>synchronous</b> step is to be performed sequentially. The steps are :
You select a random number <b>→ then</b> multiply the number by 2 <b>→ then</b> Add 2 to the multiplied number <b>→ then</b> the game is completed successfully

Also, the <b>data can be passed down the chain using return statements</b>. In the Ex:1 using the statement <b>return(randomNumbar *2) at Step 2</b>, we pass the value to <b>Step3</b>, and 8 is printed.
          `,
          code1: `// callback hell
          doSomething(function (result) {
  doSomethingElse(result, function (newResult) {
    doThirdThing(newResult, function (finalResult) {
      console.log(\`Got the final result: \${finalResult}\`);
    }, failureCallback);
  }, failureCallback);
}, failureCallback);

// Here's the magic: the "then()" function returns a "new promise", different from the original:

const promise = doSomething();
const promise2 = promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);


//----------- Ex : 1 -------------
        function numberGame() {
           return new Promise ((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    resolve(3)
                }, 2000)

                // console.log(randomNumber)

            }).then((addNumber) => {
                return addNumber + 2
            }).then((num) => {

        // numberGame().then(res => console.log(res))



//---------------- many .then to a single promise  --------------
// A classic newbie error: technically we can also add many .then to a single promise. This is not chaining.

// For example:

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});

promise.then(function(result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;

          The Promise.all() static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises fulfill (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of the fulfillment values. It rejects when any of the input's promises rejects, with this first rejection reason.
          
          One of the most amazing things about working with Javascript is its concurrency. Meaning it can run your code in parallel instead of waiting for each Promise to finish before moving starting the next. Commonly referred to as "forking".

          <b>Promise.all is a method used to execute multiple promises in parallel and wait until all of them are completed. It returns a single promise that resolves with an array of results, or rejects immediately if any one promise fails.</b>
          
          <b>Promise.all() Method</b>
👉 The <u>Promise.all()</u> method accepts an iterable Object, such as an Array of promises as an input and returns a single promise that resolves to a result array of the input promises.
👉 When all input promises have been resolved or the iterable input does not contain a promise, the returned promise will be resolved.
👉 It rejects immediately when an input promise rejects or non-promise throws an error and will reject with that <u>first rejection message / error message.</u>
👉 It is often used when there are many asynchronous tasks involved that the overall code relies on to work successfully - all of the ones we want to do before we continue to execute the code.
👉 This method aggregates the results of multiple promises.

<b>Fulfillment of Promise.all()</b>
🔹 When an <u>empty iterable</u> is passed, the promise returned by this method is executed synchronously. The resolved value will be an <u>empty array</u>.
🔹 When a <u>non-empty iterable</u> is passed, and all of the promises fulfill or are not promises,the promise returned by this method will be executed asynchronously.

<b>Rejection of Promise.all() : Fail-Fast Behavior</b>
<b>Promise.all()</b> shows <u>fail-fast</u> behavior, that is, Promise.all() <u>asynchronously</u> rejects with the value of the promise that rejected, if any of the passed-in elements are rejected.
          
          JavaScript is an asynchronous language that, most of the time, relies on promises to handle asynchronous operations. Developers face situations where multiple asynchronous tasks need to be executed concurrently, and we need a way to wait until all of them are completed before proceeding. This is where the Promise.all in JavaScript comes into play. In this blog, let us explore what js Promise.all is, its syntax and usage examples, and address common questions such as its differences from Promise. Race, handling non-promise values, managing promise rejections, compatibility, and interplay with async/await.

Promise.all in javaScript can work in the following way-
=> All or Nothing: Promise.all() waits for all promises in the iterable to settle, meaning they either all resolve or at least one rejects.
=> Single Promise Result: It returns a single promise that fulfills with an array of results when all promises in the iterable are fulfilled. The order of the results corresponds to the order of the promises in the iterable.
=> First Rejection: If any promise in the iterable is rejected, the whole Promise.all() is rejected with the reason of the first rejected promise. Subsequent rejections are ignored.

<b>Syntax</b>
The syntax of js Promise.all is relatively straightforward:

<u>Promise.all(iterable);</u> 

Here, iterable is an array or any iterable object containing promises. The Promise.all method returns a single promise that resolves when all the promises in the iterable have been resolved or rejected with the reason of the first promise that was rejected.

This method is useful for when you want to wait for more than one promise to complete.

Given an <u>Iterable</u>(arrays are <u>Iterable</u>), or a promise of an <u>Iterable</u>, which produces promises (or a mix of promises and values), iterate over all the values in the <u>Iterable</u> into an array and return a promise that is fulfilled when all the items in the array are fulfilled. The promise's fulfillment value is an array with fulfillment values at respective positions to the original array. If any promise in the array rejects, the returned promise is rejected with the rejection reason.

<b>Promise.all()</b> is a built-in helper that accepts an array of promises (or generally an iterable). The function returns a promise from where you can extract promises resolved values using a then-able syntax:

<u>If all promises are resolved successfully</u>, then <u>allPromise</u> fulfills with an array containing fulfilled values of the promises. The order of promises in the array does matter — you'll get the fulfilled values in the same order.

<b>But if at least one promise rejects</b>, then <b>allPromise</b> rejects right away (without waiting for the remaining pending promises to resolve) for the same reason.

<b>Example: 1 - all promises fulfilled</b>
To study how <u>Promise.all()</u> works, I'm going to use 2 helpers — <u>resolveTimeout(value, delay)</u> and <u>rejectTimeout(reason, delay)</u>
<u>resolveTimeout(value, delay)</u> returns a promise that fulfills with <u>value</u> after passing delay time.
<u>rejectTimeout(reason, delay)</u>, however, returns a promise that rejects with <u>reason</u> (usually an error) after passing <u>delay</u> time.

Let's access, at the same time, the lists of vegetables and fruits available at the local grocery store. Accessing each list is an asynchronous operation:
<u>const allPromise = Promise.all([...])</u> returns a new promise <u>allPromise</u>.
<u>const lists = await allPromise</u> awaits 1 second until <u>allPromise</u> fulfills with an array containing the first and second promises fulfill values.

Finally, <u>lists</u> contains the aggregated result: <u>[['potatoes', 'tomatoes'], ['oranges', 'apples']]</u>.
Note that the order of the values in the aggregated result corresponds to the order of the promises in the array supplied to <u>Promise.all()</u>:

<b> Example: 2 - one promise rejects</b>
Now imagine the situation the grocery is out of fruits. Let's reject the fruits promise with an error <u>new Error('Out of fruits!')</u>:

In this scenario <u>allPromise = Promise.all([...])</u> returns, as usual, a promise.
After 1 second the second promise rejects with an error <u>new Error('Out of fruits!').</u> This makes <u>allPromise</u> reject right away with the same <u>new Error('Out of fruits!')</u>.

Even if the vegetables' promise has been fulfilled, <u>Promise.all()</u> doesn't take it into account.

Such behavior of <u>Promise.all([...])</u> is named fail-fast. If at least one promise in the promises array rejects, then the promise returned by <u>allPromise = Promise.all([...])</u> rejects too — for the same reason.

<b> ✅ When you SHOULD use Promise.all </b>
<b>1. 🔗 When all results are required together</b>
const [user, permissions] = await Promise.all([
  getUser(),
  getPermissions(),
]);

<b>2. 🚀 When you want performance improvement over sequential calls</b>
// ❌ Slow
const a = await api1();
const b = await api2();
// ✅ Fast
const [a, b] = await Promise.all([api1(), api2()]);

<b>3. 📤 Form submission / combined operation</b>
👉 Example: submit multiple APIs together
await Promise.all([
  updateProfile(data),
  uploadDocuments(files),
]);

<b>4. 📊 Data aggregation (single UI block)</b>
👉 Example: analytics card
const [sales, revenue, users] = await Promise.all([
  getSales(),
  getRevenue(),
  getUsers(),
]);

✔ All values shown in one component
✔ Makes sense to wait for all

<b>5. 🔄 Preloading data before navigation</b>
await Promise.all([
  fetchDashboardData(),
  fetchNotifications(),
]);
navigate("/dashboard");
✔ Load everything first → smooth UX

<b>I use Promise.all when multiple independent APIs are required together and I want to optimize performance. But for dashboards with independent UI sections, I avoid it to allow better user experience with individual loading states.

Promise.all improves performance only compared to sequential API calls. If APIs are already triggered in parallel, performance remains the same. For dashboards, I prefer separate calls to allow independent loading states and better UX.”</b>

The <b>Promise.allSettled()</b> method in JavaScript is a promise combinator that waits for all promises passed to it to either resolve or reject.

          Let's say you have a list of async tasks (each return a Promise).
let promise1 = async function () {
  /* ... */
}
let promise2 = async function () {
  /* ... */
}
let promise3 = async function () {
  /* ... */
}

         What would you choose to run them?

Awaiting each promise one by one:
await promise1()
await promise2()
await promise3()
// do other stuff

Or run them all at once:

await Promise.all([promise1(), promise2(), promise3()])
// do other stuff
          
The first approach is running them sequentially, one after another. It means that the next promise will start only after the previous one is resolved.
Like this:
promise1().then(() => {
  promise2().then(() => {
    promise3().then(() => {
      // do other stuff
    })
  })
})
          
          
          <b>Is Promise.all(iterable) executing all promises?</b>
No, promises cannot "be executed", they do not consist of code that can be run. A promise is created when you start a task, and it represents the results only. It is your code that is executing everything in parallel, by starting all tasks at once to run concurrently. This happens even before (and would also happen without) passing the promises to Promise.all.

Promise.all does only await multiple promises. It doesn't care in what order they get resolved by those tasks, or whether the computations are running in parallel.

<b>is there a convenient way to run an iterable sequencially?</b>
If you already have your promises, you can't do much but Promise.all([p1, p2, p3, …]) (which does not have a notion of sequence). But if you do have an iterable of asynchronous functions, you can indeed run them sequentially. Basically you need to get from

[fn1, fn2, fn3, …]
to
fn1().then(fn2).then(fn3).then(…)

and the solution to do that is using Array::reduce:
iterable.reduce((p, fn) => p.then(fn), Promise.resolve())


The second approach is well-known as running them in <b>parallel</b>, meaning that all promises will start at the same time. It's useful when you don't need to wait for the previous promise to be resolved before starting the next one.

But does it really run in parallel (or all at once)? 

The answer is no. JavaScript is single-threaded programming language, so it can't run multiple things at the exact same time (except for some circumstances such as web workers.) <b>Promise.all()</b> actually runs them concurrently, not in parallel!

What's the difference?

<b>Concurrent programming vs Parallel programming</b>
<u>TL;DR: Concurrent programming is about dealing with a lot of things at once, while parallel programming is about doing a lot of things at once.</u>

A dead-simple example for a 9-year-old kid:
<b>Concurrency</b>: 2 lines of customers ordering food from a single cashier (lines take turns ordering).
<b>Parallelism</b>: 2 lines of customers ordering food at the same time from 2 cashiers.
As so, what <u>Promise.all()</u> does is, it adds the promises to an event loop queue and calls them all together. But it waits for each one to resolve before moving on. <u>Promise.all</u> will stop if the first promise rejects, unless you handle the error yourself (e.g. with <u>.catch()</u>).

That's the major difference between concurrent and parallel, with concurrent execution, promises run one after another but don't have to wait for previous ones to end. They make progress at the same time. In contrast, parallel execution runs promises at the exact same time in separate processes. This allows them to progress completely separately at their own speed.

        {
          text1: `Asynchronous JavaScript was introduced to help implement non-blocking code execution. Async-await took it up a notch by making it easier to work with promises and avoid the infamous callback hell.
          
          However, one has to be a bit cautious while using <b>await</b> because it blocks code i.e when <b>await</b> is used, code execution stops until the promise that it is waiting for is settled (either resolved or rejected). This is different from the <b>.then</b> and <b>.catch</b> methods that were used before it, where code execution would not pause. Regular code execution would continue and <b>.then</b> or <b>.catch</b> would be called only when the promise had settled.

When you have multiple independent <b>await</b> statements in your code block, all those statements become blocking statements, potentially breaking the async nature and the core advantage of using async-await in the first place.

<b>Real-world example</b>
Ex : 3
I'm loading three images from a remote server using the fetch method. Since <b>fetch</b> is async and I like modern JavaScript, I take the async-await approach for all asynchronous operations. I then load these images onto the DOM. I also implement a fairly basic timer that works using <b>Date</b> to get a rough estimate of how much it takes to finish the entire operation.
Make note of the time it takes to finish the operation. It took between 2 and 3 seconds for me.

<b>So what's the problem here?</b>
The three <b>await</b> statements block code execution at each step, making the images get fetched only one after the other. However, the three <b>fetchImage</b> calls can actually be made independently of one another since fetch was designed to be asynchronous. The only requirement for us is that all three promises should settle before <b>loadImages</b> is called so that valid values can be passed in as the arguments.

So, by using multiple <b>await</b> statements one after the other, what was supposed to be an async load operation has now become a synchronous, time-consuming one.
This can also be verified by inspecting the Network tab in the Dev Tools when running the code locally. Notice how the activities only happen sequentially.
If the <b>loadImages</b> call is temporarily commented out and the <b>await</b> keyword is removed, you can observe the three fetch statements happening asynchronously.

<b>Enter Promise.all()</b>
Ex : 4
By now, I hope it is established that having multiple independent <b>await</b> statements is not a good idea for performance. The solution to this problem is to use the <b>Promise.all()</b> method

It takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single promise. An array of promises is usually passed in as the iterable. The returned promise resolves when all the input promises get fulfilled. It rejects when any one of the input promises reject.

Here's how we modify our existing code
=> Omit the <b>await</b> keyword from the three <b>fetchImage()</b> calls so that <b>photo1, photo2</b>, and <b>photo3</b> become simple promises that will get a resolved value at a future time.
=> Call the <b>Promise.all()</b> method and pass in the three promises as an array
=> Handle the settled value of this promise.

If <b>allPromises</b> gets fulfilled, the fulfilled value would be an array, with each element being the resolved value of the corresponding input promise. So in our case, the resolved value will be an array of image URLs.

👉 The <u>Promise.race()</u> method returns a Promise that is resolved or rejected, as soon as one of the promises in an iterable, such as an array, fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that Promise.
👉 The promise returned will be forever pending, if the iterable passed is empty.

This returned promise fulfills when any of the input's promises fulfills, with this first fulfillment value. It rejects when all of the input's promises reject (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an AggregateError containing an array of rejection reasons.
          
          The <u>Promise.any()</u> method is one of the <u>promise concurrency</u> methods. This method is useful for returning the first promise that fulfills. It short-circuits after a promise fulfills, so it does not wait for the other promises to complete once it finds one.

          ◼️<b> Promise.any() Method</b>
👉 The Promise.any() takes an iterable Object, such as an Array of promises as an input. Once a promise is fulfilled, a single promise is returned and the promise is resolved using the value of the promise.
👉 If no promises in the iterable fulfill (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an AggregateError (that groups together individual errors).

Fulfillment of Promise.any()
🔹 Unlike <u>Promise.all()</u>, this method is used to return the first promise that fulfills.
🔹 It is <u>short-circuited</u> right after a promise is completed, so as soon as a promise is fulfilled, it will not wait for other promises to complete.
🔹 When a <u>non-empty</u> iterable is passed, and any of the promises fulfill, or are non-promises, then the promise returned by this method is fulfilled asynchronously.

For Example, the following code snippet will resolve the QuickyDone promise first as it is resolved after 100ms and the other one resolves after 500ms. It will not wait for any other promise to be fulfilled but immediately return the first promise that resolves. Ex : 1

<b>Rejection of Promise.any()</b>
🔹 Promise.any() rejects with an AggregateError if no promise fulfils.
🔹 The <u>AggregateError</u> object represents an error when several errors need to be wrapped in a single error. It is thrown when multiple errors need to be reported by an operation. Ex : 2

<b>Already rejected</b>, if the <u>iterable</u> passed is empty.
<b>Asynchronously fulfilled</b>, when any of the promises in the given <u>iterable</u> fulfills. The fulfillment value is the fulfillment value of the first promise that was fulfilled.
<b>Asynchronously rejected</b>, when all of the promises in the given <u>iterable</u> reject. The rejection reason is an <u>AggregateError</u> containing an array of rejection reasons in its <u>errors</u> property. The errors are in the order of the promises passed, regardless of completion order. If the <u>iterable</u> passed is non-empty but contains no pending promises, the returned promise is still asynchronously (instead of synchronously) rejected.

 <b>Note</b> that, Promise.any() was supported in node.js 15.0.0. If your node.js version is older than that, the console might show a TypeError: Promise.any is not a function message, so you need to update it and try again.

Asynchronous actions may sometimes fail: in case of an error the corresponding promise becomes rejected. For instance, <u>fetch</u> fails if the remote server is not available. We can use <u>.catch</u> to handle errors (rejections).

Promise chaining is great at that aspect. When a promise rejects, the control jumps to the closest rejection handler down the chain. That's very convenient in practice.
For instance, in the code below the URL is wrong (no such site) and <u>.catch</u> handles the error:`,
          code1: `fetch('https://no-such-server.blabla') // rejects
  .then(response => response.json())
  .catch(err => alert(err)) // TypeError: failed to fetch (the text may vary)
// Or, maybe, everything is all right with the site, but the response is not valid JSON:

fetch('/') // fetch works fine now, the server responds with the HTML page
  .then(response => response.json()) // rejects: the page is HTML, not a valid json
  .catch(err => alert(err)) // SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
// The easiest way to catch all errors is to append .catch to the end of chain:

fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(user => fetch(\`https://api.github.com/users/\${user.name}\`))
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(githubUser => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let img = document.createElement('img');
    img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;
    img.className = "promise-avatar-example";
    document.body.append(img);

    setTimeout(() => {
      img.remove();
      resolve(githubUser);
    }, 3000);
  }))
  .catch(error => alert(error.message));
// Normally, ".catch" doesn't trigger at all, because there are no errors. But if any of the promises above rejects (a network problem or invalid json or whatever), then it would catch it.`

          text1: `<b>Implicit try…catch</b>
The code of a promise executor and promise handlers has an <u>invisible try..catch</u> around it. If an exception happens, it gets caught and treated as a rejection.`,

  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!
// …Works exactly the same as this:

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject(new Error("Whoops!"));
}).catch(alert); // Error: Whoops!
// The “invisible try..catch” around the executor automatically catches the error and treats it as a rejection.
// This happens not only in the executor, but in its handlers as well. If we "throw" inside a ".then" handler, that means a rejected promise, so the control jumps to the nearest error handler.

// Here's an example:
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("ok");
}).then((result) => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!"); // rejects the promise

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("ok");
}).then((result) => {
  blabla(); // no such function
}).catch(alert); // ReferenceError: blabla is not defined
// The final ".catch" not only catches explicit rejections, but also occasional errors in the handlers above.`

          text1: `<b>Rethrowing</b>
As we already noticed, <u>.catch</u> behaves like <u>try..catch</u>. We may have as many <u>.then</u> handlers as we want, and then use a single <u>.catch</u> at the end to handle errors in all of them.

In a regular <u>try..catch</u> we can analyze the error and maybe rethrow it if can't handle. The same thing is possible for promises.

If we <u>throw</u> inside <u>.catch</u>, then the control goes to the next closest error handler. And if we handle the error and finish normally, then it continues to the closest successful .then handler.

In the example below the <u>.catch</u> successfully handles the error:
`,
          code1: `// the execution: catch -> then
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).catch(function(error) 
  alert("The error is handled, continue normally");
}).then(() => alert("Next successful handler runs"));
// Here the <u>.catch</u> block finishes normally. So the next successful <u>.then</u> handler is called.
// In the example below we see the other situation with <u>.catch</u>. The handler <u>(*)</u> catches the error and just can't handle it (e.g. it only knows how to handle <u>URIError</u>), so it throws it again:

// the execution: catch -> catch -> then
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).catch(function(error) { // (*)

  if (error instanceof URIError) {
    // handle it
  } else {
    alert("Can't handle such error");
    throw error; // throwing this or another error jumps to the next catch
  }

}).then(function() {
  /* never runs here */
}).catch(error => { // (**)
  alert(\`The unknown error has occurred: \${error}\`);
  // don't return anything => execution goes the normal way
});
// Then the execution jumps from the first ".catch (*)" to the next one "(**)" down the chain.

Let's improve error handling for the user-loading example.

The promise returned by fetch rejects when it's impossible to make a request. For instance, a remote server is not available, or the URL is malformed. But if the remote server responds with error 404, or even error 500, then it's considered a valid response.

What if the server returns a non-JSON page with error 500 in the line (*)? What if there's no such user, and GitHub returns a page with error 404 at (**)?`,
          code1: `fetch('no-such-user.json') // (*)

  .then(response => response.json())
  .catch(alert); // SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
  // ...
// As of now, the code tries to load the response as JSON no matter what and dies with a syntax error. You can see that by running the example above, as the file no-such-user.json doesn't exist.

// That's not good, because the error just falls through the chain, without details: what failed and where.
// So let's add one more step: we should check the response.status property that has HTTP status, and if it's not 200, then throw an error.

class HttpError extends Error { // (1)
  constructor(response) {
    super(\`\${response.status} for \${response.url}\`);
    this.name = 'HttpError';
    this.response = response;
  }
}

function loadJson(url) { // (2)
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => {
      if (response.status == 200) {
        return response.json();
      } else {
        throw new HttpError(response);
      }
    })
}

          text1: `=> We make a custom class for HTTP Errors to distinguish them from other types of errors. Besides, the new class has a constructor that accepts <u>response</u> object and saves it in the error. So error-handling code will be able to access the response.
=> Then we put together the requesting and error-handling code into a function that fetches the <u>url</u> and treats any non-200 status as an error. That's convenient, because we often need such logic.
=> Now <u>alert</u> shows a more helpful descriptive message.

The great thing about having our own class for errors is that we can easily check for it in error-handling code using <u>instanceof</u>.

For instance, we can make a request, and then if we get 404 - ask the user to modify the information.
The code below loads a user with the given name from GitHub. If there's no such user, then it asks for the correct name:
`,

What happens when an error is not handled? For instance, after the rethrow <u>(*)</u> in the example above.
Or we could just forget to append an error handler to the end of the chain, like here:

In case of an error, the promise state becomes <u>rejected</u>, and the execution should jump to the closest rejection handler. But there is no such handler in the examples above. So the error gets <u>stuck</u>. There's no code to handle it.

In practice, just like with a regular unhandled errors, it means that something has terribly gone wrong.
What happens when a regular error occurs and is not caught by <u>try..catch?</u> The script dies. Similar thing happens with unhandled promise rejections.
The JavaScript engine tracks such rejections and generates a global error in that case. You can see it in the console if you run the example above.
In the browser we can catch such errors using the event <u>unhandledrejection</u>:

The event is the part of the HTML standard.
If an error occurs, and there's no <u>.catch</u>, the <u>unhandledrejection</u> handler triggers, and gets the <u>event</u> object with the information about the error, so we can do something.
Usually such errors are unrecoverable, so our best way out is to inform the user about the problem and probably report the incident to the server.
In non-browser environments like Node.js there are other similar ways to track unhandled errors.

          text1: `<b>Async Await vs Fetch.Then()</b>
          There is three key differences between async <b>await</b> and <b>then()</b>. They boil down to syntax, error handling, and general code organization.
          
          1) With <b>await</b>, we are able to write asynchronous code in a way that looks and feels synchronous. <b>await</b> is allowing us to pause code execution until our promise is resolved and then again while parsing the JSON we get back from that fulfillment. With <b>then()</b> we are promise chaining. We are saying after this, do this, and so on and so on. This is what is allowing us to asynchronously handle the request sent to the endpoint. This promise chaining is more explicit and allows us to handle that promise in multiple ways before returning it.

          2) The next difference is how these two methods handle errors. With <b>await</b> we are able to create a <b>try</b> and <b>catch</b> code block.

          This code block is acting as an <b>if-else</b> but one designed for acting with requests. What this is doing is in the <b>try</b> if the requests is successful, continue on and return the object; otherwise, throw this error to the console and tell me the error with the requests. With <b>catch()</b>, your errors are handled in your promise chain just as your <b>then()</b>s are.

          <b>Key Difference</b>:
    => <b>.then()</b> and <b>.catch()</b> are methods on a <b>Promise</b> object — they expect <b>callback functions</b> as <b>arguments</b>.
    => <b>try {}</b> and <b>catch {}</b> are <b>language constructs</b> — part of <b>JavaScript syntax</b>, not functions.

I have touched on it already but using <b>await</b> allows you to write your code in a more linear and organized manner. You can perform subsequent operations on the fetched response immediately after the <b>await</b> statement, which can make the code flow more naturally. With <b>then()</b>, you need to chain multiple <b>then()</b> calls to handle the response and subsequent processing. This can sometimes lead to nested or cascading <b>then()</b> calls, which may make the code harder to read and maintain.

          <b>1) async/await</b>
          <b>async/await</b> is a syntactic sugar introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) that makes working with asynchronous code more readable and easier to manage compared to traditional promise chaining.
    
          <u>How It Works</u>:
    => <b>async Function</b>: Declaring a function with <b>async</b> makes it return a promise implicitly. Inside an <b>async</b> function, you can use <b>await</b> to pause execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.
    => <b>await Expression</b>: The <b>await</b> keyword pauses the execution of the <b>async</b> function until the promise is resolved, then returns the result. If the promise is rejected, <b>await</b> throws the error, which you can catch with <b>try/catch.</b>
    
    <b>Advantages</b>:
    <b>Readability</b>: The <b>async/await</b> syntax is more readable and closely resembles synchronous code.
    <b>Error Handling</b>: Error handling with <b>try/catch</b> is straightforward and integrates well with synchronous code structures.
    <b>Debugging</b>: Easier to debug due to its linear code flow.

The .then() method is a way to handle promises and is part of the Promises API. It involves chaining methods to handle the resolved or rejected state of a promise.

<u>How It Works</u>:
    <b>then() Method</b>: The <b>.then()</b> method is used to specify what should happen when the promise resolves. You can chain multiple .then() calls for sequential asynchronous operations.
    <b>catch() Method</b>: The <b>.catch()</b> method is used to handle any errors that occur during the promise chain.
    
    <u>Advantages</u>:
    <b>Chainable: .then()</b> allows chaining multiple asynchronous operations, making it flexible for complex workflows.
    <b>Compatibility</b>: Works with existing promise-based APIs and can be used in environments that do not support <u>async/await</u>.

    <b>Use .then()</b>: When working with existing code that uses promises, or when you need to chain multiple asynchronous operations. It's also useful when dealing with APIs or libraries that return promises.

Imagine you're cooking dinner and have a list of tasks, like <u> boiling water for pasta, frying chicken, and making a salad</u>.
You would do these tasks one at a time and wait for each one to finish before moving to the next.
Synchronous programming works similarly, where the computer will complete one task before moving on to the next. This makes it easy to understand and predict what the computer will do at any given time.

}

f1();

By default, every line in a function executes sequentially, one line at a time. The same is applicable even when you invoke multiple functions in your code. Again, line by line.

So what happens when you define a function and then invoke it? The JavaScript engine maintains a <u>stack</u> data structure called <u>function execution stack</u>. The purpose of the stack is to track the current function in execution. It does the following:

=> When the JavaScript engine invokes a function, it adds it to the stack, and the execution starts.
=> If the currently executed function calls another function, the engine adds the second function to the stack and starts executing it.
=> Once it finishes executing the second function, the engine takes it out from the stack.
=> The control goes back to resume the execution of the first function from the point it left it last time.
=> Once the execution of the first function is over, the engine takes it out of the stack.
=> Continue the same way until there is nothing to put into the stack.

//----------------- below IMG - 1 ---------------
Let's look at an example of three functions that execute one by one:

function f1() {
  // some code
}
function f2() {
  // some code
}
function f3() {
  // some code
}

// Invoke the functions one by one
f1();
f2();
f3();

A step-by-step flow shows the execution order

Did you see what happened there? First, <u>f1()</u> goes into the stack, executes, and pops out. Then <u>f2()</u> does the same, and finally <u>f3()</u>. After that, the stack is empty, with nothing else to execute.

Ok, let's now work through a more complex example. Here is a function <u>f3()</u> that invokes another function <u>f2()</u> that in turn invokes another function <u>f1()</u>.

`,
          code1: ``,

function f1() {
  // Some code
}
function f2() {
  f1();
}
function f3() {
  f2();
}
f3();
Let's see what's going on with the function execution stack:

A step-by-step flow shows the execution order

Notice that first <u>f3()</u> gets into the stack, invoking another function, <u>f2()</u>. So now <u>f2()</u> gets inside while <u>f3()</u> remains in the stack. The <u>f2()</u> function invokes <u>f1()</u>. So, time for <u>f1()</u> to go inside the stack with both <u>f2()</u> and <u>f3()</u> remaining inside.

First, <u>f1()</u> finishes executing and comes out of the stack. Right after that <u>f2()</u> finishes, and finally <u>f3()</u>.

The bottom line is that everything that happens inside the <u>function execution stack</u> is sequential. This is the <u>Synchronous</u> part of JavaScript. JavaScript's <u>main</u> thread makes sure that it takes care of everything in the stack before it starts looking into anything <u>elsewhere</u>.

Great! Now that we understand how <u>synchronous</u> operations work in JavaScript, let's now flip the coin and see its <u>asynchronous</u> side. Are you ready?

          text1: `<u>Asynchronous</u> programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:

=> Making HTTP requests using <u>fetch()</u>
=> Accessing a user's camera or microphone using <u>getUserMedia()</u>
=> Asking a user to select files using <u>showOpenFilePicker()</u>
So even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly.

<b>Synchronous programming</b>
Consider the following code:
const name = "Miriam";
const greeting = \`Hello, my name is \${name}!\`;
console.log(greeting);
// "Hello, my name is Miriam!"

This code:
1) Declares a string called <u>name</u>.
2) Declares another string called <u>greeting</u>, which uses <u>name</u>.
3) Outputs the greeting to the JavaScript console.
We should note here that the browser effectively steps through the program one line at a time, in the order we wrote it. At each point, the browser waits for the line to finish its work before going on to the next line. It has to do this because each line depends on the work done in the preceding lines.

That makes this a synchronous program. It would still be synchronous even if we called a separate function, like this:

function makeGreeting(name) {
  return \`Hello, my name is \${name}!\`;
}
const name = "Miriam";
const greeting = makeGreeting(name);
console.log(greeting);
// "Hello, my name is Miriam!"

Here, <b>makeGreeting()</b> is a synchronous function because the caller has to wait for the function to finish its work and return a value before the caller can continue.

          text1: `<b>Asynchronous</b> In traditional (synchronous) programming, each person would have to wait for the person before them to finish their task before starting their own. But with asynchronous programming, everyone can start and work on their tasks simultaneously without waiting for the others to finish.

Similarly, in a computer program, asynchronous programming allows a program to work on multiple tasks simultaneously instead of completing one task before moving on to the next one. This can make the program get more things done in a shorter amount of time.

Asynchronous programming is a way for a computer program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously rather than executing them one after the other.

As we saw in the synchronous code example, all instructions in the program execute one after another, and every instruction waits for its previous instruction to get executed. Due to this nature of synchronous programming, sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the user interface. Asynchronous code execution allows to execution next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow because of previous instructions.

The word <u>asynchronous</u> means <b>not occurring at the same time</b>. What does it mean in the context of JavaScript?
Typically, executing things in sequence works well. But you may sometimes need to fetch data from the server or execute a function with a delay, something you do not anticipate occurring <u>NOW</u>. So, you want the code to execute <u>asynchronously</u>.

In these circumstances, you may not want the JavaScript engine to halt the execution of the other sequential code. So, the JavaScript engine needs to manage things a bit more efficiently in this case.

We can classify most asynchronous JavaScript operations with two primary triggers:

1) <b>Browser API/Web API</b> events or functions. These include methods like <u>setTimeout</u>, or event handlers like click, mouse over, scroll, and many more.
2) <b>Promises</b>. A unique JavaScript object that allows us to perform asynchronous operations.
 Don't worry if you are new to promises. You do not need to know more than this to follow this article. At the end of the article, I have provided some links so you can start learning promises in the most beginner-friendly way.


 <b>How to Handle Browser APIs/Web APIs</b>
Browser APIs like <u>setTimeout</u> and event handlers rely on <u>callback</u> functions. A callback function executes when an asynchronous operation completes. Here is an example of how a <u>setTimeout</u> function works:

function printMe() {
  console.log('print me');
}
setTimeout(printMe, 2000);

The <u>setTimeout</u> function executes a function after a certain amount of time has elapsed. In the code above, the text <u>print me</u> logs into the console after a delay of 2 seconds.
Now assume we have a few more lines of code right after the <u>setTimeout</u> function like this:

function printMe() {
  console.log('print me');
}
function test() {
  console.log('test');
}
setTimeout(printMe, 2000);
test();

So, what do we expect to happen here? What do you think the output will be?
Will the JavaScript engine wait for 2 seconds to go to the invocation of the <u>test()</u> function and output this:

printMe
test

Or will it manage to keep the callback function of <u>setTimeout</u> aside and continue its other executions? So the output could be this, perhaps:

test
printMe

If you guessed the latter, you're right. That's where the asynchronous mechanism kicks in.

<b>How the JavaScript Callback Queue Works (aka Task Queue)</b>
JavaScript maintains a queue of callback functions. It is called a callback queue or task queue. A queue data structure is <u>First-In-First-Out(FIFO)</u>. So, the callback function that first gets into the queue has the opportunity to go out first. But the question is:

When does the JavaScript engine put it in the queue?
When does the JavaScript engine take it out of the queue?
Where does it go when it comes out of the queue?
Most importantly, how do all these things relate to the asynchronous part of JavaScript?


The below image shows the regular <u>call stack</u> we have seen already. There are two additional sections to track if a browser API (like setTimeout) kicks in and <u>queues</u> the callback function from that API.

The JavaScript engine keeps executing the functions in the call stack. As it doesn't put the callback function straight into the stack, there is no question of any code waiting for/blocking execution in the stack.

The engine creates a <u>loop</u> to look into the queue periodically to find what it needs to pull from there. It pulls a callback function from the queue to the call stack when the stack is empty. Now the callback function executes generally as any other function in the stack. The loop continues. This loop is famously known as the <u>Event Loop</u>.

So, the moral of the story is:

=> When a Browser API occurs, park the callback functions in a queue.
=> Keep executing code as usual in the stack.
=> The event loop checks if there is a callback function in the queue.

function main() {

The code executes a <u>setTimeout</u> function with a callback function <u>f1()</u>. Note that we have given zero delays to it. This means that we expect the function <u>f1()</u> to execute immediately. Right after setTimeout, we execute another function, <u>f2()</u>.

So, what do you think the output will be? Here it is:
main
f2
f1

But, you may think that <u>f1</u> should print before <u>f2</u> as we do not delay f1 to execute. But no, that's not the case. Remember the <u>event loop</u> mechanism we discussed above? Now, let's see it in a step-by-step flow for the above code.



Event loop - see the step-by-step execution

Here are steps written out:
1) The <u>main()</u> function gets inside the call stack.
2) It has a console log to print the word main. The <u>console.log('main')</u> executes and goes out of the stack.
3) The setTimeout browser API takes place.
4) The callback function puts it into the callback queue.
5) In the stack, execution occurs as usual, so <u>f2()</u> gets into the stack. The console log of <u>f2()</u> executes. Both go out of the stack.
6) The <u>main()</u> also pops out of the stack.
7) The event loop recognizes that the call stack is empty, and there is a callback function in the queue.
8) The callback function <u>f1()</u> then goes into the stack. Execution starts. The console log executes, and <u>f1()</u> also comes out of the stack.
9) At this point, nothing else is in the stack and queue to execute further.

I hope it's now clear to you how the <u>asynchronous</u> part of JavaScript works internally. But, that's not all. We have to look at <u>promises</u>.

          <b>Execution Context</b>
The JavaScript engine interacts with other engines in the browser. In the JavaScript execution stack there is global context at the bottom and then when we invoke functions the JavaScript engine creates new execution contexts for respective functions. When the called function exits its execution context is popped from the stack, and then next execution context is popped and so on...



Maybe you think setTimeout like this -: <b>The setTimeout() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds</b>. it's true, but let's dive deeper.

There aren't any methods like <u>setTimeout()</u> or <u>setInterval()</u> in JavaScript. They are not provided by the JavaScript engine itself but they are provided by browser as part of the window object. Let's break it down:

If javascript doesn't provide <u>setInterval()</u> and <u>setTimeout()</u> but when we run our javascript code which also contains <b>setTImeout</b> it works perfectly fine. Yes, that's the real problem. Many people know how to use and they don't have any idea about what's going on under the hood. Before knowing about windows object, let's look at web APIs.

<b>Web APIs</b>
A browser can perform many tasks like getting user's location, turning on/off bluetooth, storage tasks, timer related tasks and many more. And we as a developers need these things. So, all these things can be accessed by JavaScript via Web APIs. That's it, now we have all these things inside one place and that place is window object.

<b>Some web APIs</b>:
=> localStorage
=> setTimeout()
=> console
=> DOM APIs
=> fetch()
=> location
=> alert()
=> and others

If <u>setTimeout()</u> is present inside window object then why we don't write like this:
window.setTimeout(() => console.log('Timer finished'), 1000 );

Instead we write without <u>window</u> object:
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timer finished'), 1000 );

<u>window</u> is a global object and <u>setTimeout()</u> is present inside global object(at global scope), so we can access <u>setTimeout()</u> without <u>window</u> object. Not only with <u>setTimeout()</u>, we don't need to write <u>window</u> object to access <u>alert, localstorage</u>, and other web APIs.

Far by we've discussed that the browser provides web APIs, so we can use the things like <u>setTimeout()</u> but nodejs is not a browser. Then how is it possible to access <u>setTimeout()</u> in node. Well, we don't have <u>window</u> object available while working with node. But we can still access <u>setTimeout()</u>, let me tell you something at this point <u>setTimeout()</u> function in node works similar to <u>window.setTimeout()</u>, however they are not exactly same.

          A JavaScript event is a specific action that occurs within a web page or application, such as clicking on an element, moving the mouse, pressing a key, or loading a page. Essentially, events are like signals that tell the browser to execute certain code or perform specific actions in response to user interactions or other occurrences.
          
          Here's a simplified breakdown of how events work in JavaScript:

<b>Event Triggering:</b> Events can be triggered by user interactions (like clicking, hovering, typing) or by the browser itself (like when a page finishes loading).
<b>Event Handling:</b> To respond to these events, developers write event handler functions. These functions contain the instructions or code that should run when the event occurs.
<b>Event Binding:</b> Event handlers are then bound or attached to specific elements or objects on the webpage using JavaScript methods like addEventListener() or by directly assigning functions to event attributes in HTML.
<b>Event Execution:</b> When the specified event occurs, the associated event handler function is executed, allowing the webpage to respond dynamically to user actions or other events.
Understanding how events are triggered and handled in JavaScript is fundamental to building interactive and responsive web applications. It enables developers to create engaging user experiences by customizing how their websites respond to user inputs and other events.


<b>How to Create an Event in JavaScript?</b>
The following is a step-by-step guide to creating custom events:

<b>Event Initialization</b>: Begin by initializing a new event object using the Event() constructor. This object represents the custom event you want to create.
<b>Event Configuration</b>: Configure the event object by specifying its type. The event type is a descriptive string that identifies the custom event you're creating. You can also provide additional options, such as whether the event bubbles up through the DOM hierarchy or can be canceled.
<b>Dispatching the Event</b>: Once the event object is configured, you can dispatch it to trigger the custom event. Dispatching an event involves specifying the target element or object where the event should originate from and calling the dispatchEvent() method on that target.


<b>Events</b> are fired to notify code of <b>interesting changes</b> that may affect code execution. These can arise from user interactions such as using a mouse or resizing a window, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g. low battery or media events from the operating system), and other causes.

Each event is represented by an object that is based on the <b>Event</b> interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions to provide information about what happened. The documentation for every event has a table (near the top) that includes a link to the associated event interface, and other relevant information.

`,
          code1: `/ Step 1: Event Initialization
var customEvent = new Event("customEvent");

// Step 2: Event Configuration
// You can also pass additional options as the second argument, such as { bubbles: true, cancelable: true }
customEvent.initEvent("customEventType", true, true);

// Step 3: Dispatching the Event
var targetElement = document.getElementById("targetElement");
targetElement.dispatchEvent(customEvent);`,

          text1: `The browser can trigger many different types of events on the DOM(Document Object Model). The full list of all DOM event types are located here: MDN. For this blog, I'll go over some of the more frequently used DOM events, explain what the event does, and how each one is used.

Here are some of the most common event types and event names:

<b>Mouse Events</b>: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, contextmenu, mouseout, mousewheel, mouseover
<b>Touch Events</b>: touchstart, touchend, touchmove, touchcancel
<b>Keyboard Events</b>: keydown, keyup, keypress
<b>Form Events</b>: focus, blur, change, submit
<b>Window Events</b>: resize, scroll, load, unload, hashchange
Touch events are triggered on touch-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets, and touch-screen laptops. Mouse events are triggered on the majority of all browsers and devices. The MouseEvent interface represents events that occur due to the user interacting with a pointing device.

<b>The click event</b>: The onclick event occurs when the user clicks on an element.
<b>The dblclick event</b>: ondblclick event occurs when the user double-clicks on an element.
<b>Mousedown & Mouseup events</b>:A pointing device button is pressed/released on an element.
<b>Mouseout event</b>: A pointing device is moved off the element that has the listener attached.

<b>Keyboard events(keydown, keyup, keypress)</b>:
<b>Keydown</b>: Any key is pressed.
<b>keyup</b>: Any key is released.
<b>keypress</b>: Any key (except shift, Fn, or capslock) is in the pressed position(fired continuously.)

<b>Form Events(focus, blur, change, submit)</b>:
<b>focus</b>: An element that has received focus.
<b>blur</b>: An element that has lost focus.
<b>change</b>: Event that is fired for input, select, and textarea elements when an alteration to the element's value is done by the user.
<b>submit</b>: The submit button is pressed.

<b>Window Events(resize, scroll, load, unload, hashchange)</b>:
<b>resize</b>: This event fires when the document view(window) has been resized.
<b>scroll</b>: Event fires when the document view or an element has been scrolled.
<b>load/unload</b>: The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all resources such as css and images. Unload is when the document or child resource is being unloaded.
<b>hashchange</b>: This event is fired when the identifier of the URL has changed(the part of the URL that begins with a # symbol).

<b>Some other common DOM events that are used are</b>:
<b>error</b>: A resource has failed to load.
<b>abort</b>: The loading fo a resource was aborted.
<b>online</b>: The browser has gained access to the network.
<b>animationstart</b>: This event fires when a CSS animatino has started.
Event listeners are what make Javascript dynamic and fun. It allows the developer to be creative and experiment with their application to make it interesting and expressive. There are all kinds of keyword events that just about allow the user to do anything to interact with the browser. Knowing more event listener types will allow you(the developer) to become a Javascript wizard!`,

It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.

DOMContentLoaded does not wait for stylesheets to load, however deferred scripts do wait for stylesheets, and the DOMContentLoaded event is queued after deferred scripts. Also, scripts which aren't deferred or async (e.g. <b>&lt;script&gt;</b>) will wait for already-parsed stylesheets to load.

A different event, load, should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page. It is a common mistake to use load where DOMContentLoaded would be more appropriate.


<b>The Problem</b>
You want to run some JavaScript code after a page has loaded. Should you use the <b>window load</b> event or the document <b>DOMContentLoaded</b> event to determine when to run the code?

<b>The Solution</b>
The window <b>load event</b> is fired when the entire web page has been loaded. This includes the page DOM and all dependent resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and images.

The document <b>DOMContentLoaded</b> event is fired when the page DOM has been loaded and all deferred scripts have been loaded and executed.

If your JavaScript code only needs to interact with the DOM, use the <b>DOMContentLoaded</b> event. This can be useful if you want to modify the DOM once it's loaded, set up event listeners, or fetch data from an API that will be displayed in the UI. For example, if you're using a UI library, such as <b>HighCharts</b>, adding the UI element after the <b>DOMContentLoaded</b> event improves performance as it does not wait for images or CSS to be loaded before adding the chart UI element to the page:
`,
          code1: `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ()=> {
    Highcharts.chart('container', {
      // add config here
    });
});


// If your JavaScript code depends on resources like stylesheets and images, then using the window load event is a better option. For example, if you want to start an animation only once all images have been loaded do the following:
window.onload = function() {
    // code to run animation.
    HeaderTextAnimation();

      title: "Phases of JavaScript Event",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `There are three different phases during the lifecycle of a JavaScript event.

=> Capturing Phase
=> Target Phase
=> Bubbling Phase

<b>Capturing Phase</b> is when the event goes down to the element. <b>The target phase</b> is when the event reaches the element and the <b>Bubbling phase</b> is when the event bubbles up from the element.

<b>1. Event Capturing</b>
Event capturing is the first phase in the event flow process where the event is captured or detected at the highest level of the DOM hierarchy and then propagates down to the target element. Event capturing allows developers to intercept events before they reach their target, enabling global event handling and delegation. Practical use cases include implementing event delegation, validating user input, and applying consistent event handling across multiple elements.

In the event capturing phase, an event originates at the least particular element and progresses downhill to the most specific element. 

During the capture process:
=> The browser will execute if the element's outermost ancestor &lt;html&gt; has a click event handler registered for the capturing phase.
=> Then it moves on to the next element inside &lt;html&gt; and repeats the process, continuing until it reaches the immediate parent of the element that was actually selected.

<b>2. Event Targeting (Target Phase)</b>
Event targeting, also known as the “at target” phase, occurs when the event reaches the target element that triggered it. During the targeting phase, event handlers attached directly to the target element are executed, allowing for specific actions or behaviors to be applied based on the event

A target element is the most deeply nested element that generated the event. It can be accessed as “event.target”. The target element, or the element that triggered the event, receives the event.

During the target phase:
=> If the target property has an event handler for the click event registered on it, the browser will execute it.
=> If bubbles are true, the event is propagated to the selected element's direct parent, then the next, until it reaches the &lt;html&gt; element. If bubbles are false, the event is not propagated to any of the target's ancestors. (Note: Don't worry about the keyword “bubble phase”, we will discuss it in detail in the next section.)

<b>3. Event Bubbling</b>
Event bubbling is the final phase in the event flow process where the event, having been processed at the target element, propagates back up through the DOM hierarchy to the root element. Unlike event capturing, which starts from the top of the DOM tree and moves downward, event bubbling starts at the target element and moves upward. Practical implications include simplifying event handling by allowing for more concise code, enabling event delegation, and facilitating the creation of interactive components.

The bubble phase is the opposite of capturing. In the event bubbling model, an event starts at the most specific element and then flows upward to the least specific element (the document or even window).

The exact opposite of the capturing phase occurs during the bubbling phase:
=> The browser will execute if the direct parent of the element selected has a click event handler registered for the bubbling phase.
=> Then it repeats the process for the next immediate ancestor element, then the next, and so on until it reaches the &lt;html&gt; element.

<u>event.target</u> - is the “target” element that initiated the event, it doesn't change through the bubbling process.
<u>this</u> - is the “current” element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.
For instance, if we have a single handler <u>form.onclick</u>, then it can “catch” all clicks inside the form. No matter where the click happened, it bubbles up to &lt;form&gt; and runs the handler.

In <u>form.onclick</u> handler:
=> <u>this (=event.currentTarget)</u> is the &lt;form&gt; element, because the handler runs on it.

A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till &lt;html&gt;, and then to document object, and some events even reach window, calling all handlers on the path.

But any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.
The method for it is <b>event.stopPropagation()</b>.
For instance, here body.onclick doesn't work if you click on &lt;button&gt;:

<b>How to Stop Event Bubbling</b>
Event Bubbling is a default behavior for events. But in some cases, you might want to prevent this.
To prevent event bubbling, you use the <b>stopPropagation</b> method of the event object.

<b>Event.stopPropagation()</b> is a method that prevents an event from propagating up the DOM tree.

<b>How does Event.stopPropagation() work?</b>
When an event occurs on an element, it will normally bubble up through its parent elements and trigger any event listeners attached to them. By calling Event.stopPropagation(), you can stop this propagation so that the event will only trigger the listener attached to the element where it occurred, and not any of its parent elements.

<b>Why would you use it?</b>
You might use Event.stopPropagation() if you want to prevent a parent element from handling an event that was triggered on a child element. For example, if you have a button inside a div, and clicking the button should not also trigger a click event on the div, you can call Event.stopPropagation() inside the button's click event listener.

When handling events, an <b>event</b> object is passed to the handling function:
The <b>event</b> object contains properties that have information about the event that was triggered and the element it was triggered on. This object also contains methods - one of which is <b>stopPropagation()</b>.
The <u>stopPropagation</u> method of an event prevents the event from propagating to the parents and ancestors of the element the event was triggered on.

The <b>stopPropagation()</b> method prevents propagation of the same event from being called.
Propagation means bubbling up to parent elements or capturing down to child elements.

Ex : 
Because DIV 1 is inside Div 2, both DIVs get clicked when you click on DIV 1.
Check the stop propagation checkbox, and try again.
The stopPropagation() method allows you to prevent propagation of the current event.

<h5>The stopPropagation() Method</h5>
<p>Click DIV 1:</p>
<div onclick="func2()">DIV 2
  <div onclick="func1(event)">DIV 1</div>

          <b>stopPropagation</b> will prevent any parent handlers from being executed 
          <b>stopImmediatePropagation</b> will prevent any parent handlers and also any other handlers from executing
          The stopImmediatePropagation() method prevents other listeners of the same event from being called.

          <b>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b>
If an element has multiple event handlers on a single event, then even if one of them stops the bubbling, the other ones still execute.
In other words, <u>event.stopPropagation()</u> stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run.
To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, there's a method <u>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</u>. After it no other handlers execute.
As you must have understood, to make our example work, we must stop the propagation once the event handler for the button executes. We have two utilities for this - <b>event.stopPropagation()</b> and <b>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b>. Both of them block the propagation of the event once encountered. There is only one difference in their work.
The <b>event.stopPropagation()</b> stops the event from going to the next element. All handlers associated with the current element for that particular event will still get executed. This does not happen in <b>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b> where propagation stops immediately, and no event handlers execute even if they belong to the current element.
          
          If several listeners are attached to the same element for the same event type, they are called in the order in which they were added. If <b>stopImmediatePropagation()</b> is invoked during one such call, no remaining listeners will be called, either on that element or any other element.

          <b>#Event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b>
<b>Event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b> is a method that prevents an event from propagating up the DOM tree and prevents any further listeners on the current element from being called.

<b>How does it work?</b>
When an event occurs on an element, it will normally bubble up through its parent elements and trigger any event listeners attached to them. By calling <b>Event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b>, you can stop this propagation so that the event will only trigger the listener attached to the element where it occurred. Additionally, any other listeners on the same element will also be prevented from being called.

<b>Why would you use it?</b>
You might use <b>Event.stopImmediatePropagation()</b> if you want to prevent any other listeners on the same element from being called after a specific listener has been triggered. This can be useful if you have multiple listeners on the same element that might conflict with each other.


In <b>2nd</b> example, we define a React component <u>MyComponent</u> that renders a button with an <u>id</u> of "example" and a second button that simulates a click on the first button. We use the <u>useRef</u> hook to create a ref to the button element, and we use the <u>useEffect</u> hook to attach three event listeners to the button element, similar to the original example. We also define a <u>handleClick</u> function that simulates a click on the button element when the second button is clicked.

Note that we use the <u>useEffect</u> hook to attach and clean up the event listeners, similar to how we would use <u>addEventListener</u> and <u>removeEventListener</u> in JavaScript. Also, we use the <u>ref</u> attribute in React to create a reference to the button element, which we can use to attach the event listeners in the <u>useEffect</u> hook and to simulate a click in the <u>handleClick</u> function.

<b>#Event.preventDefault()</b>
<u>Event.preventDefault()</u> is a method that prevents the default behavior of an element when an event is triggered.

<b>How does it work?</b>
When an event occurs on an element, it may have a default behavior associated with it. For example, clicking on a link will normally navigate to the URL specified in the href attribute of the link. By calling <u>Event.preventDefault()</u>, you can prevent this default behavior from occurring.

<b>Why would you use it?</b>
You might use <u>Event.preventDefault()</u> if you want to prevent the default behavior of an element when an event is triggered. This can be useful if you want to provide your own behavior for an element or if you want to prevent certain actions from occurring, such as submitting a form when a button is clicked.

In below example, we define a React component <u>MyComponent</u> that renders a link with an <u>id</u> of "example-link". We define a <u>handleClick</u> function that prevents the default behavior of the link (i.e., navigating to a new page) and logs a message to the console. We attach the <u>handleClick</u> function to the <u>onClick</u> attribute of the link element, similar to how we would use <u>addEventListener</u> in JavaScript.

Note that we use the <u>href</u> attribute to set the link URL to <u>#</u> in order to prevent the page from reloading when the link is clicked. We also use the <u>onClick</u> attribute in React to attach the event handler to the link element, rather than the <u>addEventListener</u> method in JavaScript.

<b>What is a JavaScript document?</b>
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.

The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object. Properties related to window objects are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, caches, etc.

<b>There was a document object too so what about it then?</b>

The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.

The window object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser's window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.

The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows, such as <u> alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval() </u>.

Few properties and methods of window objects are,

<b>Browser Object Model (BOM)</b>
The Browser Object Model contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab. The topmost object in the BOM is the window object representing the window or tab or an iframe sometimes. Window object has properties like browser history, location and the device's screen etc. In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents a single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.

The <b>window object</b> in JavaScript provides access to the browser's history, location, and other properties and methods that allow us to interact with the browser window itself. It contains information about the browser window, like the size, the document the window contains, and the window's history.

<b>Properties</b>
<b>window.innerHeight</b> - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
<b>window.innerWidth</b> - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

<b>Methods</b>
<b>window.open()</b> - open a new window
<b>window.close()</b> - close the current window
<b>window.moveTo()</b> - move the current window
<b>window.resizeTo()</b> - resize the current window

A <b>window object</b> is a global object in JavaScript, which is available in all contexts throughout your code. You can access it directly using the window keyword.

Here are some examples of common tasks that involve the window object -
Getting the current URL of the page: <u>var currentUrl = window.location.href;</u>
Getting the width of the browser window: <u>var windowWidth = window.innerWidth;</u>
Getting the height of the browser window: <u> var windowHeight = window.innerHeight;</u>
Opening a new window: <u>window.open('http://www.example.com', '_blank');</u>

The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web page's content. The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.

The <u>W3C Document Object Model (DOM)</u> is a platform-neutral interface that enables dynamic access and updating of a document's content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.

The DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods allowing programmatic access to change its structure, style, or content.

The DOM manipulation tool offers methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML document as a node tree, with the Document object as the root node. It allows dynamic updates and interactions with web page content.

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). It is the root element that represents the html document.

These are the few methods and properties of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank">DOM</a>, to know more you can refer to MDN docs here.

The <b>document object</b> represents the structure of the web page as a whole and provides access to the content of the page, as well as methods for manipulating that content. It contains information about the content of the page, like the URL, the title, the content, and the links.

For example, we can use the document.getElementById() method to get a reference to an element on the page by its ID, or the document.createElement() method to create a new element. We can also use the window object to manipulate the browser window, such as with the window.open() method to open a new window, or the window.scrollTo() method to scroll to a specific position on the page.

<b>JavaScript Document</b>
In JavaScript, the <b>document object</b> represents the web page currently loaded in the web browser. It provides access to the content of the page, as well as methods for manipulating that content.

The <b>document object</b> is a property of the window object and is also a global object in JavaScript, which means that it is available in all contexts throughout your code. You can access it directly using the document keyword.

Below are some examples of common tasks that involve the document object -
Getting the title of the document: <u> var docTitle = document.title; </u>
Getting the last modified date of the document: <u> var modified = document.lastModified; </u>
Getting the body element of the document: <u> var bodyEl = document.body; </u>
Getting an element by its ID: <u> var el = document.getElementById('my-element'); </u>
Creating a new element: <u> var newEl = document.createElement('div'); </u>

<b>Window object</b> : It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy as shown in Figure 1.

<b>Document object</b> : Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object. In the below example, title is the property of document object.

The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.

<b>Screen</b>
Screen is the window property that holds information of browser screen. It refers to screen object associated with that window object. Used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc

Similar to document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly. Screen object doesn't have any methods as in window and document objects.

      title: "Event Delegation",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to handle events for all of its child elements. It leverages the concept of event bubbling, where an event on a child element propagates up the DOM tree to its parent elements. Instead of attaching individual event listeners to each child, the parent listener checks the event target to determine which child triggered the event and then executes the appropriate code.
          
          <b>How Event Delegation Works</b>
Instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, a single event listener is attached to a common ancestor (parent element). When an event occurs on a child, it bubbles up to the parent, where the event listener checks if the event originated from a specific child element and handles it accordingly.

Event delegation is a design pattern in JavaScript used to efficiently manage and handle events on multiple child elements by attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor element. This pattern is particularly valuable in scenarios where you have a large number of similar elements, such as list items, and want to optimize event handling.

<b>Benefits of Event Delegation</b>
<b>Improves Performance</b>
=> Attaching event listeners to multiple elements (e.g., hundreds of list items) consumes memory and CPU resources.
=> A single event listener on the parent reduces memory usage and speeds up execution.
=> Attaching a single event listener is more efficient than attaching multiple event listeners to individual elements, especially for large or dynamic lists. This reduces memory usage and improves overall performance.

<b>Handles Dynamically Added Elements</b>
=> If new elements are added to the DOM dynamically (e.g., via AJAX or JavaScript), they automatically inherit the event handling without requiring new event listeners.
=> vent delegation automatically handles events for dynamically added or removed elements within the parent element. There's no need to manually attach or remove event listeners when the DOM structure changes

<b>Reduces Redundant Code</b>
Instead of duplicating event listeners for each child, one event listener efficiently manages all child elements.

<b>Simplifies Code Maintenance</b>
Modifying or removing event handling logic is easier when it's centralized on a parent rather than scattered across multiple child elements.

<b>How event delegation works</b>
=> <b>Attach a listener to a common ancestor</b>: Instead of attaching individual event listeners to each child element, you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor element higher in the DOM hierarchy.
=> <b>Event bubbling</b>: When an event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up through the DOM tree to the common ancestor element. During this propagation, the event listener on the common ancestor can intercept and handle the event.
=> <b>Determine the target</b>: Within the event listener, you can inspect the event object to identify the actual target of the event (the child element that triggered the event). You can use properties like event.target or event.currentTarget to determine which specific child element was interacted with.
=> <b>Perform action based on target</b>: Based on the target element, you can perform the desired action or execute code specific to that element. This allows you to handle events for multiple child elements with a single event listener.

🚫 <b>Avoid event delegation when</b>:
    <b>Events Don't Bubble</b>
        Some events like focus, blur, mouseenter, and mouseleave do not bubble up the DOM tree.
        Event delegation relies on bubbling, so it won't work with these.

    <b>Precise Targeting Is Required</b>
        If different child elements have distinct behaviors, and you need to handle them separately with specific logic,
        Delegating the event to a common ancestor can make the logic messy or error-prone.

        {
          text1: `<b>Creating a Custom Event</b>:
          There are two ways to create custom events.

=> The first way is using an <b>Event</b> constructor.
=> The second way is using the <b>CustomEvent</b> constructor which we prefer.

To create a custom event we use the Event constructor or CustomEvent interface. The Event constructor creates an <b>Event</b> and <b>CustomEvent</b> creates an Event with more functionality.

The below steps are followed to create one using a new <b>Event</b>.

=> We create an event using the Event constructor.
=> We listen to this event using the <b>addEventListener()</b> method.
=> We trigger or dispatch the event using <b>element.dispatchEvent(eventName)</b> method.
=> A custom Event named <b>start</b> has now been created.

<b>bubbles</b>
The <b>bubbles</b> property specifies whether the event should be propagated upward to the parent element. Setting this to <b>true</b> means that if the event gets dispatched in a child element, the parent element can listen on the event and perform an action based on that. This is the behavior of most native DOM events, but for custom events, it is set to <b>false</b> by default.

If you only want the event to be dispatched at a particular element, you can stop the propagation of the event via <b>event.stopPropagation()</b>. This should be in the callback that listens on the event. More on this later.

<b>cancelable</b>
As the name implies, <b>cancelable</b> specifies whether the event should be cancelable.

Native DOM events are cancelable by default, so you can call <b>event.preventDefault()</b> on them, which will prevent the default action of the event. If the custom event has <b>cancelable</b> set to <b>false</b>, calling <b>event.preventDefault()</b> will not perform any action.

<b>composed</b>
The <b>composed</b> property specifies whether an event should bubble across from the shadow DOM (created when using web components) to the real DOM. If <b>bubbles</b> is set to <b>false</b>, the value of this property won't matter because you're explicitly telling the event not to bubble upward. However, if you want to dispatch a custom event in a web component and listen on it on a parent element in the real DOM, then the composed property needs to be set to <b>true</b>.

A drawback of using this method is that you can't send data across to the listener. However, in most applications, we would want to be able to send data across from where the event is being dispatched to the listener. To do this, we can use the <b>CustomEvent</b> controller

You can't also send data using native DOM events. Data can only be gotten from the event's target.

          The dispatchEvent() method is a JavaScript function used to trigger (or "dispatch") an event on a specified target (such as a DOM element, document, window, or custom object). It allows developers to programmatically fire an event, simulating user interactions or other events that might need to be triggered under specific conditions.
          
          The <b>dispatchEvent</b> method allows you to simulate an event on an element. Why do you need it: you can simulate a user clicking on a button, trying to submit a form, and so on. In this case, the event will not differ from the real one except for the <b>event.isTrusted</b> property. You can even create events with non-standard (your own) names and then call them at the right time. The method is applied to the element on which the event is to be fired. As a parameter, the method receives an event (object) created using the new Event constructor.

        {
          text1: `To generate an event programmatically, you follow these steps:

First, create a new <u>Event</u> object using <u>Event</u> constructor.
Then, trigger the event using <u>element.dispatchEvent()</u> method.
Event constructor
To create a new event, you use the <u>Event</u> constructor like this:

let event = new Event(type, [,options]);

The <u>Event</u> constructor accepts two parameters:

<b>type</b>
is a string that specifies the event type such as 'click'.

<b>options</b>
is an object with two optional properties:

=> <u>bubbles</u>: is a boolean value that determines if the event bubbles or not. If it is <u>true</u> then the event is bubbled and vice versa.
=> <u>cancelable</u>: is also a boolean value that specifies whether the event is cancelable when it is <u>true</u>.

By default, the <u>options</u> object is:
{ bubbles: false, cancelable: false}

For example, the following creates a new <u>click</u> event with the default <u>options</u> object:

let clickEvent = new Event('click');

After creating an event, you can fire it on a target element using the <u>dispatchEvent()</u> method like this:

element.dispatchEvent(event);




In Below example, the event handler is executed as if the <u>click</u> event were generated by user actions.

If the event comes from the user actions, the <u>event.isTrusted</u> property is set to <u>true</u>. In case the event is generated by code, the <u>event.isTrusted</u> is <u>false</u>. Therefore, you can examine the value of <u>event.isTrusted</u> property to check the “authenticity” of the event.

The <u>Event</u> is the base type of <u>UIEvent</u> which is the base type of other specific event types such as <u>MouseEvent, TouchEvent, FocusEvent</u>, and <u>KeyboardEvent</u>.

It's a good practice to use the specialized event constructor like MouseEvent instead of using the generic <u>Event</u> type because these constructors provide more information specific to the events.

For example, the <u>MouseEvent</u> event has many other properties such as <u>clientX</u> and <u>clientY</u> that specify the horizontal and vertical coordinates at which the event occurred relative to the viewport:

let clickEvent = new MouseEvent("click", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    clientX: 150,
    clientY: 150
});

The dispatchEvent() method of the EventTarget sends an Event to the object, (synchronously) invoking the affected event listeners in the appropriate order. The normal event processing rules (including the capturing and optional bubbling phase) also apply to events dispatched manually with dispatchEvent().

          code1: `//HTML:

let clickEvent = new Event('click');

      note: [
        {
          text1: `The term <b>debounce</b> comes from electronics. When you're pressing a button, let's say on your TV remote, the signal travels to the microchip of the remote so quickly that before you manage to release the button, it bounces, and the microchip registers your “click” multiple times.
          To mitigate this, once a signal from the button is received, the microchip stops processing signals from the button for a few microseconds while it's physically impossible for you to press it again.
          
          <b>Debounce in JavaScript</b>
In JavaScript, the use case is similar. We want to trigger a function, but only once per use case.
Let's say that we want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it.
Or we want to save changes on a form, but only when the user is not actively working on those changes, as every "save" costs us a database trip.

<b>In below example</b>
<b>debounce() function</b>: It is the higher order function that takes (delay) and function(func) as the arguments. It returns a new function that will wait for the specified delay before calling the original function.
<b>clearTimeout()</b>: It is used to clear any previous set timeout so that if the event is triggered repeatedly the function call does not happen too quickly.
<b>setTimeout()</b>: This method is used to set the timeout after clearing the previous timeouts.
<b>Search function</b>: It is the placeholder for the function we want to debounce.
<b>How Does Debouncing Work?</b>
In JavaScript the debouncing function works when the event is being triggered. The Debounce wait for the specific period to run the function, it doesn't run the function immediately. If before the wait time is over, the event is triggered again then the previous function call is canceled and it resets the timer. Once the timer completes without any further event triggers, the function is executed. This ensures that the function is executed only after the event stops occurring for a specific period.

<b>Use Cases for Debouncing in JavaScript</b>
The use cases of the debouncing in javaScript are mentioned below:
<b>Search Input Field</b>: In the search bar, the user types characters one after another due to which for each key press an API request is triggered. Debouncing makes sure that the API request is only sent when the user has finished typing.
let timer;
document.getElementById("searchInput").addEventListener("input", () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => console.log("Searching..."), 300);
});

<b>Window Resizing</b>: When we resize the window browser, in a short interval of time the resize event gets fired multiple times. Debouncing can be used in handling this event.
let timer;
window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => console.log("Window resized"), 500);
});

<b>Scroll Events</b>: When the user scrolls the webpage the scroll event is triggered multiple times per second. By debouncing the event, the scroll handler function is executed only after the user has stopped scrolling for a specific duration.
let timer;
window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => console.log("Scrolling stopped"), 300);
});

<b>Form Validation</b>: If in real-time we are validating a form as the user types, debouncing can be used to ensure that for every keystroke the validation function is not repeatedly triggered.
let timer;
document.getElementById("formInput").addEventListener("input", () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => console.log("Validating..."), 500);
});


<b>Benefits of Debouncing</b>
Improved Performance: Debouncing helps in optimizing the performance by reducing the number of times of function execution, especially when we are handling frequent events like type. This reduces unnecessary resource usage.
Better User Experience: When the events are rapidly triggered then also the application remains responsive with debouncing.
Prevents Redundant API Calls: Debouncing ensures that the API requests are only sent when the user stops interacting with the page for a specific time. This helps the server from crashing with repeated requests.

      title: "What is Throttling?",
      note: [
        {
          text1: `Throttling is a technique that limits the rate at which a function can be called. It ensures that a function is executed at most once in a specified time interval, regardless of how many times it's invoked. This is particularly useful for performance-intensive operations or when you want to control the rate of API calls.
          
<b>How Throttling Works</b>
-> When a throttled function is called, it checks if enough time has passed since its last execution.
-> If the time threshold has not been met, the function call is ignored.
-> If the time threshold has been met, the function is executed and the timer is reset.

<b>How to Implement Throttling in JavaScript</b>
Let's first understand what we want to achieve with throttling:
-> Call the function immediately the first time.
-> After each call, prevent the function from being called again for a certain time period.
-> Once that time period has passed, the function can be called again.

<b>Why is Throttling Needed?</b>
Certain user interactions, like scrolling or window resizing, trigger events multiple times per second. Executing event handlers at such a high frequency can lead to performance issues, including:
-> Increased CPU and memory usage.
-> Unresponsive user interfaces.
-> Inefficient API calls leading to server strain.
