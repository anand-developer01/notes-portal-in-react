                    Chained comparison, in programming, involves combining multiple comparison operations within a single expression, making the code more concise and readable. For example, instead of writing x > y and y > z, you can write x > y > z in Python. This allows you to check if multiple conditions are met in a sequence. 

                    Checking multiple conditions in a single expression is common in programming. In Python, comparison operator chaining allows us to write cleaner, more readable code when evaluating multiple conditions. Instead of using multiple and conditions, Python enables chaining comparisons directly in a mathematical-style expression.

    Repetition of a set of statements in a program is made possible using looping constructs.

    => Looping constructs provide the facility to execute a set of statements in a program repetitively, based on a condition.
    => The statements in a loop are executed again and again as long as the particular logical condition remains true.
    => This condition is checked based on the value of a variable called the loop's control variable
    => When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates.

    => Repetition statements are called loops, and are used to repeat the same code multiple times in succession.
    => Python has two types of loops: Condition-Controlled and Count-Controlled
    => Condition-Controlled loop uses a true/false condition to control the number of times that it repeats - <b>while</b>. Basic syntax:
    while condition:
       statement(s) # notice the indent from of this line relative to the while

    Count-Controlled loop repeats a specific number of times - <b>for</b>. Basic syntax:

Python supports an optional <b>else block</b> to be associated with a for loop. If a <b>else block</b> is used with a <b>for loop</b>, it is executed only when the for loop terminates normally.

The for loop terminates normally when it completes all its iterations without encountering a break statement, which allows us to exit the loop when a certain condition is met.

The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a for statement in Python. Till the count is less than 5, the iteration count is printed. As it becomes 5, the print statement in else block is executed, before the control is passed to the next statement in the main program.

<b>For-Else Construct without break statement</b>

                    Closure =
    An inner function(Nested Function)
    Defined inside an outer function
    Accesses variables from the outer function's scope
    Returned by the outer function
    
    <b>What is __closure__?</b>
    Every function object has a special attribute called __closure__
    If the function is a <b>closure</b>, this will be a <b>tuple of "cell" objects</b>, each storing one of the <b>enclosed variables</b>

    <b>How to Check If It's a Closure</b>
    All function objects have a __closure__ attribute that returns a tuple of cell objects if it is a closure function.
You can inspect the closure using <b>__closure__</b>:
print(double.__closure__)  // # Tuple of cell objects
print(double.__closure__[0].cell_contents)  // # Output: 2


                <b>(Ex : 2)</b> This code executes the outer function <b>calculate()</b> and returns a closure to the odd number. 
That's why we can access the <b>num</b> variable of <b>calculate()</b> even after completing the outer function.
Again, when we call the outer function using
<b>odd2 = calculate()</b>
a new closure is returned. Hence, we get 3 again when we call odd2().

<b>When to use closures?</b>
Closures can be used to avoid global values and provide data hiding, and can be an elegant solution for simple cases with one or few methods.

1. Data Hiding (Encapsulation)
Closures let you hide variables from the outer world—similar to private variables in object-oriented programming.

Use Case:

def counter():
    count = 0
    def increment():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return increment

inc = counter()
print(inc())  # 1
print(inc())  # 2

You can't access count directly, but the function still "remembers" its value.


📌 2. When You Need to Retain State Without Using a Class
Closures are an elegant alternative to classes when you need a function with state.

class Adder:
    def __init__(self, base):
        self.base = base

    def add(self, x):
        return self.base + x

Use a closure:

def make_adder(base):
    def adder(x):
        return base + x
    return adder

add10 = make_adder(10)
print(add10(5))  # 15

📌 3. When Writing Decorators
Closures are the foundation of decorators in Python.

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function call")
        func()
        print("After the function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()


📌 4. Factory Functions
Closures can be used to <b>generate multiple customized functions.</b>

def power_factory(n):
    def power(x):
        return x ** n
    return power

square = power_factory(2)
cube = power_factory(3)

print(square(5))  # 25
print(cube(5))    # 125
`,
                    code1: `// ---------- Ex : 1 ----------
                    def outer():
    x = 10  # Enclosed variable

    def inner():

    return inner  # returning inner function

closure_fn = outer()  # outer is called, inner is returned
closure_fn()          # Output: x is 10

// -------- Ex : 2 ----------

    def multiply_by(n):
        return n * factor

print(double(5))  # Output: 10
print(triple(5))  # Output: 15

//------
// You can inspect the closure using __closure__:

print(double.__closure__[0].cell_contents) //  # Output: 2

                    text1: `In Python, *args and **kwargs are used to allow functions to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. These features provide great flexibility when designing functions that need to handle a varying number of inputs.
                    
                    In programming, we define a function to make a reusable code that performs similar operation. To perform that operation, we call a function with the specific value, this value is called a function argument in Python.
                    
                    Let's understand *args and **kwargs in Python — these are used when <b>you don't know in advance how many arguments</b> a function will receive.

                    In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:

                    We use Python *args and **kwargs when we are unsure about the number of arguments to pass. *args is used for non-keyworded arguments that we can pass to a function and perform operations, whereas **kwargs is used for a variable number of keyworded arguments passed to a function and performs dictionary operations.

1) *args (Non Keyword Arguments)
2) **kwargs (Keyword Arguments)

We use <b>*args</b> and <b>**kwargs</b> as an argument when we are unsure about the number of arguments to pass in the functions.

 <b>Are *args and **kwargs Python keywords?</b>
🔸 No, args and kwargs are not reserved keywords in Python.
🔸 But * and ** have special meaning in function definitions:

    <b>*</b> unpacks positional arguments into a tuple
    <b>**</b> unpacks keyword arguments into a dict
     You can name them anything:

def my_func(*values, **options):
    print(values)   # tuple of args
    print(options)  # dict of kwargs

    -> Using *args and **kwargs makes your code:
    -> Easier to read
    -> Familiar to other developers

<b>Python *args - (Ex : 1)</b>
Python *args
In Python, *args is used to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. It collects these arguments into a tuple, allowing you to handle multiple values without specifying them one by one.

We use Python *args when we’re unsure how many arguments a function might receive during a call.

Key Points to Remember
-> *args collects extra positional arguments into a tuple.
-> It must appear after standard arguments in the function definition.
-> You can loop through args just like a tuple.
-> The name doesn’t have to be args, but the asterisk * is required.


<b>Python **kwargs (Ex : 2)</b>
We use **kwargs in function definitions to pass keyworded variable-length arguments to functions. Please note that we can’t use **kwargs in Python to pass keyword arguments.

We use kwargs with double ** before the parameter name because it allows us to pass any number of arguments. 

Key Points to Remember
-> The keyworded arguments are passed as a dictionary. 
-> A keyword argument allows you to provide a variable name as we pass it into the function.
-> Python considers a variable name with two stars (**) before it a keyword argument.
-> kwargs is like a dictionary that maps every keyword to the value passed alongside it. Therefore, when we iterate over kwargs, there is no order in which they are printed.

                    text1: `<b>What is a Lambda Function?</b>
Lambda functions are similar to user-defined functions but without a name. They're commonly referred to as anonymous functions.

Lambda functions are efficient whenever you want to create a function that will only contain simple expressions – that is, expressions that are usually a single line of a statement. They're also useful when you want to use the function once.

You can define a lambda function like this:
We use the <b>lambda keyword</b> instead of <b>def</b> to create a lambda function. Here's the syntax to declare the lambda function:
<b>lambda argument(s) : expression</b>
Here,
<b>argument(s)</b> - any value passed to the lambda function
<b>expression </b>- expression is executed and returned

-> lambda is a keyword in Python for defining the anonymous function.
-> argument(s) is a placeholder, that is a variable that will be used to hold the value you want to pass into the function expression. A lambda function can have multiple variables depending on what you want to achieve.
-> expression is the code you want to execute in the lambda function.

Notice that the anonymous function does not have a return keyword. This is because the anonymous function will automatically return the result of the expression in the function once it is executed.

Let's look at an example of a lambda function to see how it works. We'll compare it to a regular user-defined function.

Assume I want to write a function that returns twice the number I pass it. We can define a user-defined function as follows:

def f(x):
  return x * 2

f(3)
>> 6

Now for a lambda function. We'll create it like this:
lambda x: x * 3

<b>When Should You Use a Lambda Function?</b>
You should use the lambda function to create simple expressions. For example, expressions that do not include complex structures such as if-else, for-loops, and so on.

<b>Common Use Cases for Lambda Functions</b>
How to Use a Lambda Function with Iterables
An iterable is essentially anything that consists of a series of values, such as characters, numbers, and so on.

In Python, iterables include strings, lists, dictionaries, ranges, tuples, and so on. When working with iterables, you can use lambda functions in conjunction with two common functions: <b>filter()</b> and <b>map()</b>.

<b>Filter()</b>
When you want to focus on specific values in an iterable, you can use the filter function. The following is the syntax of a filter function:

filter(function, iterable)

Firstly I will use the lambda function to create the expression I want to derive like this:

lambda x: x % 2 == 0
Then I will insert it into the filter function like this:

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, list1)

>> <filter at 0x1e3f212ad60> # The result is always filter object so I will need to convert it to list using list()

list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, list1))
>> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

<b>Pandas Series - (Ex : 3)</b>
Another place you'll use lambda functions is in data science when creating a data frame from Pandas. A series is a data frame column. You can manipulate all of the values in a series by using the lambda function.

df["lower_name"] = df["name"].apply(lambda x: x.lower())
The apply function will apply each element of the series to the lambda function. The lambda function will then return a value for each element based on the expression you passed to it. In our case, the expression was to lowercase each element.

                    A generator expression in Python provides a concise and memory-efficient way to create a generator object. It is syntactically similar to a list comprehension but uses parentheses <b>()</b> instead of square brackets <b>[]</b>.
                    
                    In Python, generators are a special type of iterator created using the <b>def</b> keyword followed by the <b>yield</b> statement. Unlike regular functions that use <b>return</b> to provide a single value, generator functions use <b>yield</b> to produce a sequence of values on demand.
                    <b>Ex : 1</b>
->                     A generator is a <b>special kind of iterator</b>.
-> It’s defined like a regular function using <b>def</b>, but instead of <b>return</b>, it uses <b>yield</b>.
-> Each call to <b>next()</b> on the generator <b>resumes from where it left off</b>, not from the beginning.

The state of the generator is maintained through the <b>yield</b> keyword, and its code only executes when <b>next()</b> is called on the generator object. Generators also support advanced methods like <b>.send(), .throw()</b>, and <b>.close()</b> for more complex use cases.

<b>The "Lazy" Magic</b>
The core difference between a list comprehension and a generator expression is <b>lazy evaluation</b>.

When you run a list comprehension, Python immediately calculates every single value and loads the entire list into your computer's RAM. A generator expression, on the other hand, is a recipe. It doesn't calculate anything until you explicitly ask for the next value. It yields one item, pauses, and waits for you to ask again.

<b>List comprehensions</b>
They are the most common type of comprehension in Python. They allow you to create a new list by applying an expression to each element of an existing iterable. The basic syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:

<b>new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]</b>
Here's a breakdown of the components:
-> <b>expression</b>: The operation or transformation applied to each element.
-> <b>item</b>: The variable representing each element in the iterable.
-> <b>iterable</b>: The sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) being iterated over.
-> <b>condition (optional)</b>: A conditional statement to filter elements.
<b>Ex : 1</b>
# List Comprehension (uses square brackets)
squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares_list) 
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
# Generator Expression (uses parentheses)
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(5))
print(squares_gen) 
# Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x10a2b5350>

<b>Ex : 2</b>
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Incorrect ❌
# eves = [num for num in arr: if num % 2 == 0]

# Correct ✅
eves = [num for num in arr if num % 2 == 0] 
# Output: [2, 4]

<b>Ex : 3</b>
eves = [num for num in arr<b style="color:red">:</b> if num % 2 == 0] // SyntaxError: invalid syntax
❌ Problem:
You added a colon (<b>:</b>) after arr, which is not allowed in list comprehensions.
In Python, colons are used in for loops or if blocks, but not in list comprehensions.


transpose = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))] <b>Ex : 4</b>
This means:
-> Outer loop: <b>for i in range(len(matrix[0]))</b> → loop over column indices (0, 1, 2)
-> Inner loop: <b>for row in matrix</b> → for each row, get the <b>i</b>-th element
-> So you're collecting all the i-th elements from each row → that becomes a new row in the transposed matrix


<b>Equivalent Generator Function</b>
A generator expression is shorthand for a generator function.
Generator expression:
squares = (x * x for x in range(5))

Equivalent generator function:
def generate_squares():
    for x in range(5):
        yield x * x

squares = generate_squares()

Both produce values lazily (on demand).


<b>When to Use Generator Expressions</b>
Use them when:
Processing large datasets
Passing values directly to functions like <b>sum(), max(), min(), join(), any(), all()</b>
You don't need to store all results in memory

Examples:
-> total = sum(x * x for x in range(100))
-> result = any(x > 10 for x in [1, 5, 15, 3])
-> text = ",".join(str(x) for x in range(5))


<b> *** List Comprehension [] vs Generator Expression () </b>
<b>Syntax:</b>
    List Comprehensions use square brackets: <b>[x for x in range(10)]</b>
    Generator Expressions use parentheses: <b>(x for x in range(10))</b>

<b>Execution Method (Eager vs. Lazy):</b>
    -> <b>List Comprehensions are eager</b>. They compute the entire sequence immediately and return a fully populated list before moving to the next line of code.
    -> <b>Generator Expressions are lazy</b>. They do not compute anything upfront. They simply create a generator object that pauses and yields the next item only when explicitly asked.

<b>Memory Usage:</b>
    -> <b>List Comprehensions require high memory</b>. If you generate 10 million items, your computer must allocate enough RAM to hold all 10 million items at once.
    -> <b>Generator Expressions are highly memory-efficient</b>. They only hold one item in memory at a time alongside the state of the loop, meaning the memory footprint is tiny and constant regardless of the dataset size.

<b>Reusability:</b> 
    -> List Comprehensions are persistent. Because the data is saved in memory, you can loop over the list as many times as you need.
    -> Generator Expressions are single-use. Once an item is generated, it is forgotten. If you finish iterating through the generator, it is "exhausted" and will be empty if you try to loop through it again.

<b>Supported Operations:</b>
    -> List Comprehensions support standard list features. You can check their length <b>(len(arr))</b>, slice them <b>(arr[1:4])</b>, and access specific indices directly <b>(arr[3])</b>.
    -> Generator Expressions strictly forbid indexing, slicing, and len(). Because the values haven't been generated yet, Python doesn't know how long it is or what the 5th item will be without calculating the first 4.

<b>Performance:</b>
    -> List Comprehensions are faster overall if your final goal requires storing all the elements in memory anyway (like returning a complete dataset).
    -> Generator Expressions have a nearly instant initialization time and are much faster when you are scanning through data looking for a specific condition (because you can break the loop early without having computed the rest of the sequence).

                    text1: `When developing software with Python, a basic approach is to install Python on your machine, install all your required libraries via the terminal, write all your code in a single .py file or notebook, and run your Python program in the terminal.

This is a common approach for a lot of beginners and many people transitioning from working with Python for data analytics.

This works fine for simple Python scripting projects. But in complex software development projects, like building a Python library, an API, or software development kit, often you will be working with multiple files, multiple packages, and dependencies. As a result, you will need to isolate your Python development environment for that particular project.

Consider this scenario: you are working on app A, using your system installed Python and you pip install packageX version 1.0 to your global Python library. Then you switch to project B on your local machine, and you install the same packageX but version 2.0, which has some breaking changes between version 1.0 and 2.0.

When you go back to run your app A, you get all sorts of errors, and your app does not run. This is a scenario you can run into when building software with Python. And to get around this, we can use virtual environments.

<b>What is a Virtual Environment?</b>
Python's official documentation says:

"A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system"

A Python Virtual Environment is an isolated space where you can work on your Python projects, separately from your system-installed Python. You can set up your own libraries and dependencies without affecting the system Python. We will use virtualenv to create a virtual environment in Python.

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most Python developers use.     

<b>Why use a virtual environment?</b>
    -> Each project can use different versions of the same package.
    -> Avoids polluting the global Python environment.
    -> Makes deployment easier and cleaner.

<b>🔧 How to create and use a virtual environment</b>
<b>1. Create a virtual environment</b>
python -m venv <span>env</span>
    env is the name of the virtual environment folder. You can name it anything.
    This creates a directory with Python binaries and local site-packages.
                (OR)
    $ /n/fs/myproject/py310/bin/python3.10 -m venv my_venv_py310
The -m <b>venv</b> tells Python to use the “venv” module to create a virtual environment in a directory called my_venv_py310.


<b>2. Activate the virtual environment</b>
    => On Windows:
<b>./\env/\Scripts/\activate</b>

=> On macOS/Linux:
    <b>source <span style="color:red">env</span>/bin/activate</b>
<b>env</b> is just the <b>name of the virtual environment folder</b> — and yes, you can name it anything you want.
After activation, your terminal prompt usually changes to show the environment name.

<b>3. Install packages inside the environment</b>
pip install flask
This installs <b>flask</b> only inside your virtual environment.

<b>4. Freeze dependencies</b>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This saves the installed packages to a file, useful for sharing or deployment.
Freezing dependencies means saving a list of all the Python packages (and their exact versions) that are installed in your virtual environment.

<b>5. Deactivate the virtual environment</b>
deactivate

<b>🔁 Recreate environment from requirements.txt</b>
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or ./\env/\Scripts/\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

<b>🧠 Tools that help manage environments</b>
    <b>venv</b> - built-in tool (recommended for most use cases)
    <b>virtualenv</b> - older third-party tool, used when venv is not available
    <b>pipenv</b> - combines package + environment management
    <b>conda</b> - for data science, handles packages + environments
    `,
                    code1: `//If you created your environment like this:
python -m venv myproject_env

// Then to activate it:

                    text1: `<b>What is __name__?</b>
In contrast, the “__main__“ string that is being matched in the if statement does have special semantics. Each time a Python module is imported, Python automatically assigns a string name to the dunder name (__name__) variable in that module's namespace; normally this is the name of the module being imported as defined by its source file name (or package hierarchy name). The outermost module—the one that is there every time you run Python and requires no import—is always assigned “__main__“ as its name. It is the main module that is always present. (See the Python Execution Model documentation for more details.)

The if __name__ == "__main__" block in Python allows you to define code that will only run when the file is executed directly as a script, but not when it's imported as a module into another script.

=> Every Python file (module) has a special built-in variable called <b>__name__</b>.
=> When a Python file is run directly (like <b>python myfile.py</b>), then Python sets <b>__name__ = "__main__"</b> in that file.
=> But if the file is <b>imported</b> from another file (like import myfile), then <b>__name__ = "myfile"</b> (i.e., the module name).

<b>Why is __name__ useful?</b>
The reason that <b>__name__</b> is useful has to do with the fact that Python runs the code that it is importing as a module. Doing an import populates the module's namespace with the variables, functions, and classes defined in the module. With <b>__name__</b> I have a way to control what actually runs and the context in which it runs.

Purpose of <b>if __name__ == "__main__":</b>
It tells Python:
<b>Only run the below code if this file is being executed directly, not when imported.</b>

    Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

list.<b>pop</b>([i])
    Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. It raises an IndexError if the list is empty or the index is outside the list range.

list.<b>clear</b>()
    Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].

    The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.

list.<b>count</b>(x) - <b> Ex : 3 </b>
    Return the number of times x appears in the list.
    list.count(x) is a built-in method in Python that <b>returns the number of times the specified element x appears in the list.</b>
    <b>📚 Theoretical Explanation</b>:
    -> It iterates through the entire list.
    -> Compares each element with the given value x using == equality.
    -> Increments a counter each time it finds a match.
    -> Finally, returns the total count of matches found.

list.<b>sort</b>(*, key=None, reverse=False)
    Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).

list.<b>reverse</b>()
    Reverse the elements of the list in place.

list.<b>copy</b>()
    Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].

                    Dictionaries are Python's implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.

You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:

-> A dictionary in Python is a <b>mutable collection of key-value pairs</b> that allows for efficient data retrieval using unique keys.
-> Both dict() and {} can create dictionaries in Python. Use {} for <b>concise syntax</b> and dict() for <b>dynamic creation</b> from iterable objects.
-> <b>dict()</b> is a <b>class</b> used to create dictionaries. However, it's <b>commonly called a built-in function</b> in Python.
-> <b>.__dict__ is a special attribute</b> in Python that holds an object's <b>writable attributes</b> in a dictionary.
-> Python dict is implemented as a <b>hashmap</b>, which allows for <b>fast key lookups</b>.

Dictionaries are one of Python's most important and useful built-in data types. They provide a mutable collection of key-value pairs that lets you efficiently access and mutate values through their corresponding keys:

<b>Python's dictionaries have the following characteristics</b>:
<b>Mutable</b>: The dictionary values can be updated in place.
<b>Dynamic</b>: Dictionaries can grow and shrink as needed.
<b>Efficient</b>: They're implemented as hash tables, which allows for fast key lookup.
person["city"] = "Hyderabad" # Add new key-value
<b>Ordered</b>: Starting with Python 3.7, dictionaries keep their items in the same order they were inserted.
The keys of a dictionary have a couple of restrictions. They need to be:

<b>Hashable</b>: This means that you can't use unhashable objects like lists as dictionary keys.
<b>Unique</b>: This means that your dictionaries won't have duplicate keys.

<b>1. Keys must be unique</b>
d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "a": 3}
print(d)  # {'a': 3, 'b': 2}
The last "a" overwrites the first.

<b>2. Values can be of any type</b>
person = {
    "name": "Anand",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": ["Python", "React"],
    "is_employed": True
}

print(person["name"])      # Output: Anand
print(person.get("age"))   # Output: 30
print(person.get("city", "Unknown"))  # Default if key not found

<b>4. Adding or Updating Items</b>
person["city"] = "Hyderabad"         # Add new key-value
person["age"] = 31                   # Update existing

<b>5. Deleting Items</b>
del person["city"]        # Deletes key 'city'

                    text1: `<b>Encapsulation</b> is the concept of <b>hiding internal data</b> and only exposing what is necessary.
It <b>binds data (variables)</b> and <b>methods (functions)</b> that work on that data into a single unit (class), and it <b>restricts direct access</b> to some of the object's components.

It involves combining data and its related methods into a single unit called “class”, which restricts direct access to variables and methods and helps prevent unintended changes to the data.

This promotes better code organization and reusability. Overall, encapsulation is essential for building robust software systems.

In object-oriented programming, encapsulation is a mechanism that enables the bundling of data and methods and restricts access to the data from outside the class. Private and public variables are two ways of controlling access to class variables.

-> A real-life example of this concept could be a car. The car's driver can interact with various features, such as the steering wheel, pedals, and dashboard. These features are accessible to the driver and are similar to public variables. 
 -> However, the driver cannot see or interact with many parts of the car, such as the engine and transmission. These parts are similar to private variables, accessible only within the class or object.
 -> By using private and public variables in encapsulation, we can control access to an object's data and ensure that it is only modified in a controlled way. 
 -> It makes managing the object's behavior easier and protects its internal data from being accidentally modified.

 Encapsulation in Python is achieved through the use of access modifiers which restrict access to the methods and variables of a class. This helps in bundling the data (variables) and the methods that act on the data into a single unit or class. Python primarily uses two types of access modifiers: public and private.

1. Public Members: In Python, members of a class that are accessible from outside the class are public. By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public. They can be accessed using the dot operator on an object.

2. Private Members: To make an attribute or method private (i.e., accessible only within the class), you precede its name with two underscores (\`__\`). This triggers a name mangling process, where the interpreter modifies the name of the variable in a way that makes it harder to create subclasses that accidentally override the private attributes and methods.

<b>Public</b>	self.name	Accessible from outside
<b>Protected</b>	self._name	Convention: Treat as internal
<b>Private</b>	self.__name	Name mangling (harder to access directly)

<b>public</b>	No underscore	Can be accessed from anywhere.
<b>_protected</b>	Single underscore <b>( _var )</b>	Shouldn't be accessed outside the class (not enforced).
<b>__private</b>	Double underscore <b>( __var )</b>	Name mangled to prevent outside access (enforced).

It is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which allows developers to implement more complex functionality without worrying about the underlying complexity.

                    <b>Abstraction</b> means <b>hiding the complex implementation details</b> and showing only the <b>essential features</b> of an object. It's a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Python supports it using:

                    In Python, abstraction can be achieved using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods. Let's explore how we can implement this using Python's built-in abc module.
                    Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
<b>@abstractmethod</b> decorator
<b>Abstract Method</b>: An abstract method is a method that is declared but contains no implementation. It is just a placeholder that tells the programmer that this method must be overridden by subclasses.
 In Python, abstract method feature is not a default feature. To create abstract method and abstract classes we have to import the "ABC" and "abstractmethod" classes from abc (Abstract Base Class) library. Abstract method of base class force its child class to write the implementation of the all abstract methods defined in base class. If we do not implement the abstract methods of base class in the child class then our code will give error. In the below code method_1 is a abstract method created using @abstractmethod decorator.
<b>Abstract Class</b>: A class containing one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly.

<b>ABC</b>	Base class for defining abstract classes
<b>@abstractmethod</b>	Marks a method that must be implemented in child classes
<b>Cannot instantiate</b>	You cannot create an object of an abstract class
<b>Enforces implementation</b>	All abstract methods must be implemented in child classes

                {
                    text1: `Polymorphism means <b>"many forms"</b>. In Python, it refers to the ability of different classes to provide different implementations for methods that share the same name.
                    
                    <b>Real-life Example</b>:
    -> A person behaves differently as a teacher, a father, or a friend — depending on the situation.
    -> Similarly, in Python, a method name can behave differently based on the object calling it.

    <b>Method Overriding</b>
    Method overriding is a fundamental concept in <u>object-oriented programming (OOP)</u> that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

This concept is crucial as it enables polymorphism, where different classes can implement methods in different ways while sharing the same method name. By overriding methods, developers can customise or extend the behavior of inherited methods without altering the original class.

<b>Implementation in Python</b>
In Python, method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name and signature as a method in its superclass. When an instance of the subclass calls this method, the overridden version in the subclass executes, replacing the superclass's method.

This behavior demonstrates Python's support for dynamic method dispatch, a key feature of polymorphism.

To override a method in Python, you simply define a method in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass. Python does not require any special syntax for overriding methods, making it straightforward to implement. Here's an example:(Ex: 1)

    <b>Method Overloading</b>
    Method overloading is a feature in programming that allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters. It enhances code readability and reusability by enabling methods to perform different tasks based on the arguments passed.

This concept is particularly useful in data science for creating flexible and adaptable functions, such as those used in data manipulation or statistical calculations.

<b>NOTE</b> : last definition overrides the previous one.
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Anand")
 What happened?

    -> The first greet() was <b>overwritten (shadowed)</b> by the second one.
    -> Python only keeps the last defined function with a given name.
    -> So calling greet() without a parameter now gives an error:
TypeError: greet() missing 1 required positional argument: \`name\`


<b>Implementation in Python</b>
Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not support method overloading natively. In Python, defining multiple methods with the same name within a class will overwrite the previous definitions. However, Python's dynamic nature and support for default arguments, variable-length arguments, and keyword arguments allow for similar functionality.

To achieve method overloading, developers can use default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs). These techniques enable a single method to handle different numbers and types of arguments, simulating the effect of method overloading.(Ex : 4)

<b>*args</b>	Variable number of positional arguments	<u>Tuple</u>
<b>**kwargs</b>	Variable number of keyword arguments	<u>Dictionary</u>

    <b>Note</b>: Python does not support method overloading. We may overload the methods but can only use the latest defined method.

 <b>   Practical Applications in Data Science</b>
Understanding method overloading and overriding in Python has practical benefits in data science. These concepts play a critical role in simplifying and enhancing various data science tasks, from preprocessing data to evaluating models and customising algorithms.

                ( <b>Ex : 1</b> )Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning.

                    a <b>static method</b> is a type of method that does not require any instance to be called. It is very similar to the class method but the difference is that the static method doesn't have a mandatory argument like reference to the object - <b>self</b> or reference to the class - <b>cls</b>.

                    There can be some functionality that relates to the class, but does not require any instance(s) to do some work, static methods can be used in such cases. A static method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class. It can't access or modify class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class. A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. 

                    <b>How to Create Static Method in Python?</b>
There are two ways to create Python static methods -
Using staticmethod() Function
Using @staticmethod Decorator

<b>Using staticmethod() Function</b>
Python's standard library function named staticmethod() is used to create a static method. It accepts a method as an argument and converts it into a static method.

Syntax
staticmethod(method)

When function decorated with @staticmethod is called, we don't pass an instance of the class to it as it is normally done with methods. It means that the function is put inside the class but it cannot access the instance of that class. <b>Example #1</b>:

                text1: `<b>MRO (Method Resolution Order)</b> is the order in which Python <b>looks up methods and attributes</b> when you call them on an object — especially when <b>multiple inheritance</b> is involved.
                
                <b>Why is MRO important?</b>
When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, the same method or attribute might be defined in more than one parent.
MRO helps Python decide:
<b>🧭 "Which class's method should be used first?"</b>
<b>Python uses the C3 Linearization Algorithm to compute MRO.</b>

<b>1. Using .mro() method</b>:
print(D.mro())

<b>✅ 2. Using built-in function super()</b>:
    -> <b>super()</b> uses MRO under the hood.
    -> So calling <b>super().method()</b> always follows the MRO chain.

    <b>What is &lt;class &#39;object&#39;&gt; in Python?</b>
    In Python, object is the base class for all classes.

When you see &lt;class &#39;object&#39;&gt; in MRO like this:
print(D.mro())
[&lt;class &#39;__main__.D&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;__main__.B&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;__main__.C&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;__main__.A&#39;&gt;, &lt;class &#39;object&#39;&gt;]
D → B → C → A → object <b>( Ex : 1 )</b>
It means the class <b>D (and its parents)</b> ultimately inherit from Python's <b>built-in object</b> class.

Why is <b>object</b> important?
    It's the <b>top-most parent</b> in Python's class hierarchy.
    All classes (even your custom classes) <b>automatically inherit from object</b>, either directly or indirectly.

            note: [
                {
                    text1: `Exception handling allows you to catch and manage runtime errors in your code, so the application doesn't crash and can respond gracefully.
                    
                    Python Exception Handling handles errors that occur during the execution of a program. Exception handling allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly. 
                    
                    <b>Difference Between Exception and Error</b>
<b>Error</b>: Errors are serious issues that a program should not try to handle. They are usually problems in the code's logic or configuration and need to be fixed by the programmer. Examples include syntax errors and memory errors.
<b>Exception</b>: Exceptions are less severe than errors and can be handled by the program. They occur due to situations like invalid input, missing files or network issues.

<b>Syntax and Usage</b>
try:
      # Code that might raise an exception
except SomeException:
      # Code to handle the exception
else:
     # Code to run if no exception occurs
finally:
    # Code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs
    
    <b>try, except, else and finally Blocks</b>
<b>try Block</b>: try block lets us test a block of code for errors. Python will "try" to execute the code in this block. If an exception occurs, execution will immediately jump to the except block.
<b>except Block</b>: except block enables us to handle the error or exception. If the code inside the try block throws an error, Python jumps to the except block and executes it. We can handle specific exceptions or use a general except to catch all exceptions.
<b>else Block</b>: else block is optional and if included, must follow all except blocks. The else block runs only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. This is useful for code that should execute if the try block succeeds.
The <b>else</b> block <b>executes only if there is no error</b> in the <b>try</b> block.
<b>finally Block</b>: finally block always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations (closing files, releasing resources).

<b>1. Catching Multiple Exceptions</b>
We can catch multiple exceptions in a single block if we need to handle them in the same way or we can separate them if different types of exceptions require different handling.

<b>2. Custom Exception Classes Ex : 4, Ex : 5, Ex : 6</b>
For domain-specific errors, define your own exceptions:

<b>3. Logging Exceptions</b>
In production apps (Flask/Django), you shouldn't just print() errors — you should log them.

            note: [
                {
                    text1: `Running multiple tasks <b>at the same time</b> in a single process using threads.
                    A thread is a lightweight unit of a process
Threads share memory space with the main thread

In Python, multithreading allows you to run multiple threads concurrently within a single process, which is also known as thread-based parallelism. This means a program can perform multiple tasks at the same time, enhancing its efficiency and responsiveness.

A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Also, it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS (Operating System). In simple words, a thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process! A thread contains all this information in a Thread Control Block (TCB) :

Multithreading in Python involves creating and managing multiple threads within a program. Threads execute concurrently, enabling parallel execution of tasks. This can improve performance, facilitate concurrent operations, and enhance responsiveness, especially for I/O-bound tasks or operations involving waiting.

To achieve multithreading in Python, we can use the following two modules:
The Thread Module
The Threading Module

Each thread runs <b>independently</b>, so:
    Your main program continues
    Background tasks (like a timer, loader, or scheduled function) run in parallel
    
    <b>Delayed Execution</b>	time.sleep() ->	setTimeout()
<b>Repeated Execution</b>	threading.Timer() ->  setInterval()
<b>True Multithreading</b>	threading.Thread ->	Web Workers (kinda)
<b>Async Execution</b>	asyncio ->	JS Promises/async

We use threading.main_thread() function to get the main thread object. In normal conditions, the main thread is the thread from which the Python interpreter was started. name attribute of the thread object is used to get the name of the thread. Then we use the threading.current_thread() function to get the current thread object.

The main thread will exit whenever it has finished executing all the code in your script that is not started in a separate thread. For instance, when you start a new thread using start() method, the main thread will continue to execute the remaining code in the script until it reaches the end and then exit.

<b>Which thread starts first: Main thread or Child thread?</b>
    <b>The main thread always starts first.</b>
It is the entry point of every Python program. When you run a script, it begins executing in the main thread. Only after that can you create and start child threads.
In Python, when a program starts, the default thread that executes the program's code is the Main Thread. Any other threads created within the program, referred to as Child Threads, are initiated by the Main Thread.

Therefore, the Main Thread starts first, as it is the initial entry point for the program's execution. Child threads are subsequently created and started by the Main Thread using methods like <b>Thread.start()</b>. While child threads run concurrently with the Main Thread after being started, the Main Thread is always the first to begin execution.

You can check which thread your code is running on with <b>threading.current_thread() == threading.main_thread().</b>

<b>Key Point for Interviews</b>:
    Even though you call <b>t.start()</b> from the main thread, the actual execution of the child thread is <b>scheduled by the OS</b>, so their <b>execution order may vary</b>, but the <b>main thread always starts first</b>.

                    The join() method in Python's threading module is used to block the calling thread (typically the main thread) until the thread on which join() is called has completed its execution. 

                    In Python, thread_object.join() is used to block the calling thread until the thread on which join() is called has finished executing. It ensures that a thread completes its task before the main program or another thread continues. This is essential for managing dependencies between threads and avoiding race conditions.

                    text1: `In the programming world, the concept of "non-blocking" is pervasive. JavaScript developers often use the term "asynchronous" because it is one of JavaScript's strengths. However, to truly understand asynchronous programming, it's essential to grasp the concepts of concurrent and parallel programming.

<b>Concurrent Programming</b>
When several independent entities are working simultaneously, the programming is concurrent. It doesn't necessarily mean that these tasks are running at the exact same time. Instead, it means that tasks are making progress over time by sharing resources, such as CPU time. The main advantage of concurrent programming is its robustness: if one process crashes, the rest of your program continues to function.

<b>Parallel Programming</b>
If an algorithm can divide its work into several parts, it is parallel. The more processors you have, the more you benefit from parallelism. Efficient parallel programming optimizes the resources of modern machines for better performance.

<b>Illustrating Concurrency vs. Parallelism with Cooking</b>
<b>Concurrency Example</b>:
Imagine you are preparing a meal where you need to grill some meat and make a sauce. You start by putting the meat on the barbecue. While the meat is grilling, you chop the tomatoes and other vegetables for the sauce. Then, you begin boiling the sauce while occasionally checking on the meat. Here, both tasks (grilling the meat and making the sauce) are in progress, but you are switching your attention between them. This represents concurrency.

<b>Parallelism Example</b>:
Now, let's say you have a friend to help you. While you focus on grilling the meat, your friend takes care of making the sauce. Both tasks are being done simultaneously without the need to switch attention between them. This represents parallelism.

<b>What is Asynchronous Programming?</b>
Asynchronous programming involves handling input/output (I/O) operations that occur outside your program, such as user input, printing to a terminal, reading from a socket, or writing to disk. The key characteristics of asynchronous I/O are:

The time taken by the operation is not CPU-dependent. Instead, it depends on factors like disk speed, network latency, and other external conditions.

The program cannot predict when the operation will end.

For services with significant I/O (like web servers, databases, and deployment scripts), optimizing these operations can greatly improve performance.

Let's see examples of blocking code and non-blocking code.`,

// In this asynchronous program, tasks run concurrently, reducing the total execution time. Let's explore the components of asynchronous programming.

<b>Components of Asynchronous Programming</b>
Event loops, coroutines, and futures are the essential elements of an asynchronous Python program.

<b>Event Loop</b>: Manages task switching and execution flow, keeping track of tasks to be run asynchronously.

<b>Coroutines</b>: Special functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run during the wait. A coroutine specifies where in the function the task-switching event should take place, returning control to the event loop. Coroutines are typically created by the event loop and stored internally in a task queue.

<b>Futures</b>: Placeholders for results from coroutines, storing the result or exceptions. As soon as the event loop initiates a coroutine, a corresponding future is created that stores the result of the coroutine, or an exception if one was thrown during the coroutine's execution.

                    <b>async</b> declares an asynchronous function
<b>await</b> pauses the function execution until the awaited task completes

<b><span style="color:red">asyncio.run()</span></b>: is used to <b>run an async function</b> from the <b>top-level</b> of your Python program.
It starts the <b>event loop</b>, runs your coroutine, and then <b>closes the loop</b> automatically when it's done.
Start the async engine, run this coroutine, and shut it down when finished.

<b>1. “This function runs the passed coroutine…”</b>
✔️ It means you pass an async def function to asyncio.run(), and it will run that function completely — start to finish.

-> This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

-> This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

-> If debug is <b>True</b>, the event loop will be run in debug mode.
    You can pass debug=True to help detect bugs in your async code:
asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)

-> This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

<b>Note</b>: asyncio.run() must be called only once per program — it's for top-level scripts only, not inside another running event loop (like in Jupyter notebooks).

<b><span style="color:red">asyncio.sleep()</span></b>
    <b>asyncio.sleep()</b> is a non-blocking version of <b>time.sleep()</b> used in asynchronous (async) functions.

It pauses the current coroutine without blocking the entire program — allowing other async tasks to run during the wait.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.
sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.
Syntax :  await asyncio.sleep(seconds)

    <b>Ex : 2</b>
    -> 🔁 <b>get_running_loop()</b> returns the <b>active event loop</b> (which is auto-created by asyncio.run()).
    -> You can use this to access precise <b>event-loop-based time</b>, which is monotonic (never goes backward).
    print(loop)
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    -> 🕒 <b>loop.time()</b> gives current time from event loop (in seconds).
    -> So end_time = now + 5 seconds.
->     Prints the current real-world time every second.
-> Runs until ~4 seconds have passed, because it's checking:
loop.time() + 1.0 >= end_time


<b><span style="color:red">asyncio.gather</span></b>

Coroutines functions in Python are preceded by the keyword <b>async</b>.

                    text1: `<b>Network Programming Basics</b>
Network programming involves writing software that allows different systems and applications to communicate over a network. This can range from simple applications, like sending messages between computers, to more complex systems, such as distributed databases and web servers. Network programming is essential in today's connected world, enabling everything from browsing the internet to conducting secure online transactions.

<b>Understanding Networking Concepts</b>
Before diving into Python's capabilities for network programming, it's important to understand some fundamental networking concepts:

<b>Network Protocols</b>: These are rules and conventions for communication between network devices. Common protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is reliable and makes sure that data is delivered in order, making it suitable for applications like web browsing and email. UDP, on the other hand, is faster but does not guarantee delivery or order, making it suitable for applications like live video streaming and online gaming.
<b>IP Addresses</b>: Every device on a network has a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address, which acts as its identifier. There are two versions of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, typically written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1). IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers, written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons.
<b>Ports</b>: Ports are numerical identifiers for specific processes or services on a device. For example, web servers typically use port 80 for HTTP traffic and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. When data is sent to an IP address, the port number indicates which application should receive the data.
<b>Sockets</b>: A socket is an endpoint for communication between two devices. It combines an IP address and a port number to uniquely identify a connection. Sockets provide a way for software to read and write data across the network.

<b>The Role of Python in Network Programming</b>
The Python includes several built-in libraries that simplify network tasks, such as:

<b>socket</b>: This library provides low-level access to network interfaces, allowing you to create and manage network connections using both TCP and UDP protocols.
<b>http.client and http.server</b>: These libraries offer higher-level functions for creating HTTP clients and servers, making it easier to build web-based applications.
<b>urllib and requests</b>: These libraries simplify working with URLs and handling HTTP requests, enabling you to interact with web APIs and download content from the web.
<b>asyncio</b>: This library provides support for asynchronous programming, allowing you to handle multiple network connections concurrently without blocking the main execution thread.

<b>Why Use Python for Network Programming?</b>
There are several reasons why Python is a popular choice for network programming:

<b>Simplicity and Readability</b>: Python's clean syntax and readability make it easier to write and understand network code, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making maintenance simpler.
<b>Extensive Libraries</b>: Python's standard library includes many modules for network programming, and there are numerous third-party libraries available for more specialized tasks.
<b>Cross-Platform Compatibility</b>: Python is cross-platform, meaning that code written on one operating system will typically run on another with little or no modification. This is particularly useful in network programming, where applications often need to run on different types of devices.
<b>Community and Support</b>: Python has a large and active community of developers, providing a wealth of resources, tutorials, and libraries. This makes it easier to find solutions to problems and get help when needed.

<b>Practical Applications of Python in Network Programming</b>
Python can be used for a wide range of network programming tasks, including:

<b>Creating Web Servers</b>: Python can be used to create web servers that handle HTTP requests and serve web pages or APIs. Frameworks like Flask and Django simplify the process of building web applications.
<b>Developing Network Tools</b>: Python is often used to create tools for network diagnostics, monitoring, and management. Examples include network scanners, packet sniffers, and traffic analyzers.
<b>Automating Network Tasks</b>: Python scripts can automate various network-related tasks, such as configuring network devices, managing network services, and performing regular network maintenance.
<b>Building Chat Applications</b>: Python can be used to create real-time chat applications that allow users to communicate over a network. These applications can range from simple command-line tools to complex, feature-rich messaging platforms.

<b>Creating Sockets in Python</b>
Sockets are fundamental to network programming as they provide the interface for sending and receiving data between devices on a network. In Python, the socket module is used to create and manage sockets, supporting both TCP and UDP protocols. Here we will go through the process of creating sockets and establishing basic network communication.

<b>Understanding Sockets</b>
A socket is essentially a combination of an IP address and a port number, creating a unique endpoint for network communication. There are two main types of sockets:

<b>Stream Sockets (TCP)</b>: These sockets use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to provide reliable, connection-oriented communication. They make sure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
<b>Datagram Sockets (UDP)</b>: These sockets use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to provide connectionless communication. They are faster but do not guarantee delivery or order, making them suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability.

<b>Creating a TCP Socket</b>
Creating a TCP socket in Python is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

<b>Import the socket module</b>: The <b>socket</b> module provides the necessary functions and constants for network communication.
<b>Create a socket object</b>: Use the <b>socket.socket()</b> function to create a new socket object.
Bind the socket to an address and port</b>: Use the <b>bind()</b> method to associate the socket with a specific IP address and port number.
<b>Listen for incoming connections</b>: Use the <b>listen()</b> method to enable the socket to accept connections.
<b>Accept a connection</b>: Use the <b>accept()</b> method to wait for an incoming connection. This method returns a new socket object representing the connection and the address of the client.
<b>Receive and send data</b>: Use the <b>recv()</b> and <b>sendall()</b> methods to receive and send data over the connection.
<b>Close the connection</b>: Use the <b>close()</b> method to close the socket when done.

<b>Creating a UDP Socket</b>
Creating a UDP socket is similar to creating a TCP socket, but with some differences. UDP sockets are connectionless, meaning there is no need to establish a connection before sending data. Here’s how to create a UDP socket:

Import the <b>socket</b> module.
Create a socket object using the <b>socket.socket()</b> function with <b>socket.AF_INET</b> and <b>socket.SOCK_DGRAM</b>.
<b>Bind the socket to an address and port</b> using the <b>bind()</b> method.
<b>Send and receive data</b> using the <b>sendto()</b> and <b>recvfrom()</b> methods.

<b>Error Handling in Sockets</b>
Network communication can be unpredictable, so it's important to handle errors gracefully. Python's <b>socket</b> module raises exceptions for various errors, such as <b>socket.error, socket.timeout</b>, and <b>socket.gaierror</b>. You can use try-except blocks to handle these exceptions and make sure your program can recover from errors:

<b>Client-Server Communication</b>
Client-server communication is a fundamental concept in network programming. It involves two main components: the client, which initiates the communication, and the server, which responds to the client’s requests. This section will guide you through the process of implementing client-server communication in Python using both TCP and UDP protocols.

<b>Implementing TCP Client-Server Communication</b>
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that makes sure reliable and ordered delivery of data. It is commonly used in applications where data integrity is crucial, such as web servers and email clients.

<b>TCP Server</b>
First, let's create a simple TCP server that listens for incoming connections and echoes back any data it receives. This server will run indefinitely, handling one connection at a time.

<b>IP address</b>	A unique address assigned to each device in a network (e.g., 127.0.0.1)
<b>Port</b>	A logical endpoint for communication (e.g., Flask runs on port 5000)
<b>Protocol</b>	Rules for data exchange, like HTTP, TCP, UDP
<b>Client/Server</b>	Client sends request → Server responds
<b>Socket</b>	Endpoint for sending/receiving raw data
<b>DNS</b>	Translates names like google.com to IP addresses
<b>CORS</b>	Security rule that restricts how websites from different origins communicate`,
